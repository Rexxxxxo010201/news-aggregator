April home sales dropped to the slowest pace for that month since 2009 - CNBC,business,"Home sales in April dropped, as consumers faced high home prices and growing concern over the economy and employment.",Diana Olick,CNBC,2025-05-22T14:00:20+00:00,"A ""Sale"" sign in front of a home in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, May 8, 2025.

The spring housing market continues to struggle amid high interest rates and low consumer confidence. Sales of previously owned homes in April declined 0.5% from March to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 4 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is the slowest April pace since 2009. Sales were down 2% from April of last year. Housing economists were expecting a gain of 2.7%. This count is based on closings, meaning contracts that were likely signed in February and March, before mortgage rates moved higher in April. ""Home sales have been at 75% of normal or pre-pandemic activity for the past three years, even with seven million jobs added to the economy,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, in a release. ""Pent-up housing demand continues to grow, though not realized. Any meaningful decline in mortgage rates will help release this demand."" Inventory jumped 9% month to month and was nearly 21% higher than April of last year. There were 1.45 million homes for sale at the end of April, which at the current sales pace represents a 4.4-month supply. That is the highest level in five years, but still below the six-month supply which is considered a balanced market. One year ago, there was a 3.5-month supply. More supply is starting to cool prices. The median price of an existing home sold in April was $414,000, an increase of just 1.8% year over year. That is the highest April price on record, but the slowest appreciation since July 2023. Annual price gains had been much higher last year. Both the South and West regions saw prices fall. ""At the macro level, we are still in a mild seller's market,"" Yun said. ""But with the highest inventory levels in nearly five years, consumers are in a better situation to negotiate for better deals."" Homes sat on the market an average 29 days, faster than March, but longer than April of last year. First-time buyers accounted for 34% of sales, almost the same as last year. Cancellation rates, or how many people cancel their contracts, are also rising, hitting 7% of sales in April. That is up from a recent average of 3% to 4%. Activity is still stronger on the higher end of the market. Sales of homes priced more than $1 million rose nearly 6% from a year ago. Those priced between $100,000 and $250,000 dropped just over 4%. Yun, however, noted that the gains on the high end are shrinking. ""I think that is partly due to the stock market shakeout that has occurred,"" he said."

Stephen Maturen | Getty Images News | Getty Images It took six months, countless hours on hold and intervention from state regulators before Sue Cover says she finally resolved an over $1,000 billing dispute with UnitedHealthcare in 2023. Cover, 46, said she was overbilled for emergency room visits for her and her son, along with a standard ultrasound. While Cover said her family would eventually have been able to pay the sum, she said it would have been a financial strain on them. Cover, a San Diego benefits advocate, said she had conversations with UnitedHealthcare that ""felt like a circular dance."" Cover said she picked through dense policy language and fielded frequent calls from creditors. She said the experience felt designed to exhaust patients into submission. ""It sometimes took my entire day of just sitting on the phone, being on hold with the hospital or the insurance company,"" Cover said. Cover's experience is familiar to many Americans. And it embodies rising public furor toward insurers and in particular UnitedHealthcare, the largest private health insurer in the U.S., which has become the poster child for problems with the U.S. insurance industry and the nation's sprawling health-care system. The company and other insurers have faced backlash from patients who say they were denied necessary care, providers who say they are buried in red tape and lawmakers who say they are alarmed by its vast influence. UnitedHealthcare in a statement said it is working with Cover's provider to ""understand the facts of these claims."" The company said it is ""unfortunate that CNBC rushed to publish this story without allowing us and the provider adequate time to review."" CNBC provided the company several days to review Cover's situation before publication. Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealthcare's company, UnitedHealth Group, stepped down earlier this month for what the company called ""personal reasons."" Witty had led the company through the thick of public and investor blowback. The insurer also pulled its 2025 earnings guidance this month, partly due to rising medical costs, it said. UnitedHealth Group is by far the biggest company in the insurance industry by market cap, worth nearly $275 billion. It controls an estimated 15% of the U.S. health insurance market, serving more than 29 million Americans, according to a 2024 report from the American Medical Association. Meanwhile, competitors Elevance Health and CVS Health control an estimated 12% of the market each. It's no surprise that a company with such a wide reach faces public blowback. But the personal and financial sensitivity of health care makes the venom directed at UnitedHealth unique, some experts told CNBC. Shares of UnitedHealth Group are down about 40% this year following a string of setbacks for the company, despite a temporary reprieve sparked in part by share purchases by company insiders. In the last month alone, UnitedHealth Group has lost nearly $300 billion of its $600 billion market cap following Witty's exit, the company's rough first-quarter earnings and a reported criminal probe into possible Medicare fraud. In a statement about the investigation, UnitedHealth Group said, ""We stand by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program."" Over the years, UnitedHealthcare and other insurers have also faced numerous patient and shareholder lawsuits and several other government investigations. UnitedHealth Group is also contending with the fallout from a February 2024 ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary that processes a significant portion of the country's medical claims. More recently, UnitedHealthcare became a symbol for outrage toward insurers following the fatal shooting of its CEO, Brian Thompson, in December. Thompson's death reignited calls to reform what many advocates and lawmakers say is an opaque industry that puts profits above patients. The problems go deeper than UnitedHealth Group: Insurers are just one piece of what some experts call a broken U.S. health-care system, where many stakeholders, including drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, are trying to balance patient care with making money. Still, experts emphasized that insurers' cost-cutting tactics - from denying claims to charging higher premiums - can delay or block crucial treatment, leave patients with unexpected bills, they say, or in some cases, even mean the difference between life and death. In a statement, UnitedHealthcare said it is ""unfortunate that CNBC appears to be drawing broad conclusions based on a small number of anecdotes."" What's wrong with the health-care industry Traders work at the post where UnitedHealth Group is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Brendan McDermid | Reuters Frustration with insurers is a symptom of a broader problem: a convoluted health-care system that costs the U.S. more than $4 trillion annually. U.S. patients spend far more on health care than people anywhere else in the world, yet have the lowest life expectancy among large, wealthy countries, according to the Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group. Over the past five years, U.S. spending on insurance premiums, out-of-pocket co-payments, pharmaceuticals and hospital services has also increased, government data show. While many developed countries have significant control over costs because they provide universal coverage, the U.S. relies on a patchwork of public and private insurance, often using profit-driven middlemen to manage care, said Howard Lapin, adjunct professor at the University of Illinois Chicago School of Law. But the biggest driver of U.S. health spending isn't how much patients use care - it's prices, said Richard Hirth, professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan. There is ""unbelievable inflation of the prices that are being charged primarily by hospitals, but also drug companies and other providers in the system,"" said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Lapin said factors such as overtreatment, fraud, health-care consolidation and administrative overhead raise costs for payers and providers, who then pass those on through higher prices. U.S. prescription drug prices are also two to three times higher than those in other developed countries, partly due to limited price regulation and pharmaceutical industry practices such as patent extensions. While patients often blame insurers, the companies are only part of the problem. Some experts argue that eliminating their profits wouldn't drastically lower U.S. health-care costs. Still, UnitedHealthcare and other insurers have become easy targets for patient frustration - and not without reason, according to industry experts. Their for-profit business model centers on managing claims to limit payouts, while complying with regulations and keeping customers content. That often means denying services deemed medically unnecessary, experts said. But at times, insurers reject care that patients need, leaving them without vital treatment or saddled with hefty bills, they added. Insurers use tools such as deductibles, co-pays, and prior authorization - or requiring approval before certain treatments - to control costs. Industry experts say companies are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence to review claims, and that can sometimes lead to inaccurate denials. ""It's all part of the same business model - to avoid paying as many claims as possible in a timely fashion,"" said Dylan Roby, an affiliate at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. How UnitedHealth Group got so powerful Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group, testifies during the Senate Finance Committee hearing titled ""Hacking America's Health Care: Assessing the Change Healthcare Cyber Attack and What's Next,"" in the Dirksen Building in Washington, D.C., on May 1, 2024. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images While other private U.S. insurers employ many of the same tactics, UnitedHealth Group appears to have faced the most public backlash due to its size and visibility. UnitedHealth Group's market value dwarfs the sub-$100 billion market caps of competitors such as CVS, Cigna and Elevance. UnitedHealth Group booked more than $400 billion in revenue in 2024 alone, up from roughly $100 billion in 2012. It has expanded into many parts of the health-care system, sparking more criticism of other segments of its business - and the company's ability to use one unit to benefit another. UnitedHealth Group grew by buying smaller companies and building them into its growing health-care business. The company now serves nearly 150 million people and controls everything from insurance and medical services to sensitive health-care data. UnitedHealth Group owns a powerful pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, called Optum Rx, which gives it even more sway over the market. PBMs act as middlemen, negotiating drug rebates on behalf of insurers, managing lists of drugs covered by health plans and reimbursing pharmacies for prescriptions. But lawmakers and drugmakers accuse them of overcharging plans, underpaying pharmacies and failing to pass savings on to patients. Owning a PBM gives UnitedHealth Group control over both supply and demand, Corlette said. Its insurance arm influences what care is covered, while Optum Rx determines what drugs are offered and at what price. UnitedHealth Group can maximize profits by steering patients to lower-cost or higher-margin treatments and keeping rebates, she said. The company's reach goes even further, Corlette added: Optum Health now employs or affiliates with about 90,000 doctors - nearly 10% of U.S. physicians - allowing UnitedHealth Group to direct patients to its own providers and essentially pay itself for care. A STAT investigation last year found that UnitedHealth uses its physicians to squeeze profits from patients. But the company in response said its ""providers and partners make independent clinical decisions, and we expect them to diagnose and document patient information completely and accurately in compliance with [federal] guidelines."" Other insurers, such as CVS and Cigna, also own large PBMs and offer care services. But UnitedHealth Group has achieved greater scale and stronger financial returns. ""I think the company is certainly best in class when it comes to insurers, in terms of providing profits for shareholders,"" said Roby. ""But people on the consumer side probably say otherwise when it comes to their experience."" Backlash against UnitedHealth UnitedHealth Group Inc. headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota. Mike Bradley | Bloomberg | Getty Images No one knows exactly how often private insurers deny claims, since they aren't generally required to report that data. But some analyses suggest that UnitedHealthcare has rejected care at higher rates than its peers for certain types of plans. A January report by nonprofit group KFF found that UnitedHealthcare denied 33% of in-network claims across Affordable Care Act plans in 20 states in 2023, one of the highest rates among major insurers. CVS denied 22% of claims across 11 states, and Cigna denied 21% in eight states. In a statement, UnitedHealthcare said that the percentage does not reflect the company's overall claims denial rate. It added that those plans represent less than 2% of UnitedHealthcare's total claims. The company said there is a lack of ""standardization in the industry regarding claim protocols,"" which can result in fully paid claims being reported as denials. UnitedHealthcare said claims are approved more than 93% of the time after care is delivered. In December, the company also pushed back on public criticism around its denial rates, saying it approves and pays about 90% of claims upon submission. UnitedHealthcare's website says the remaining 10% go through an additional review process. The company says its claims approval rate stands at 98% after that review. In addition, UnitedHealth Group is facing lawsuits over denials. In November, families of two deceased Medicare Advantage patients sued the company and its subsidiary, alleging it used an AI model with a ""90% error rate"" to deny their claims. UnitedHealth Group has argued it should be dismissed from the case because the families didn't complete Medicare's appeals process. A spokesperson for the company's subsidiary, NaviHealth, also previously told news outlets that the lawsuit ""has no merit"" and that the AI tool is used to help providers understand what care a patient may need. It does not help make coverage decisions, which are ultimately based on the terms of a member's plan and criteria from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the reported Justice Department criminal probe outlined by the Wall Street Journal targets the company's Medicare Advantage business practices. In its statement, the company said the Justice Department has not notified it about the reported probe, and called the newspaper's reporting ""deeply irresponsible."" Inside the company, employees say customers and workers alike face hurdles. One worker, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, said UnitedHealthcare's provider website often includes doctors listed as in-network or accepting new patients when they're not, leading to frequent complaints. Management often replies that it's too difficult to keep provider statuses up to date, the person said. UnitedHealthcare told CNBC it believes ""maintaining accurate provider directories is a shared responsibility among health plans and providers,"" and that it ""proactively verifies provider data on a regular basis."" The vast majority of all inaccuracies are due to errors or lack of up-to-date information submitted by providers, the company added. Emily Baack, a clinical administrative coordinator at UMR, a subsidiary of UnitedHealthcare, criticized the length of time it can take a provider to reach a real support worker over the phone who can help assess claims or prior authorization requests. She said the company's automated phone system can misroute people's calls or leave them waiting for a support person for over an hour. But Baack emphasized that similar issues occur across all insurance companies. She said providers feel compelled to submit unnecessary prior authorization requests out of fear that claims won't be paid on time. Baack said that leads to a massive backlog of paperwork on her end and delays care for patients. UnitedHealthcare said prior authorization is ""an important checkpoint"" that helps ensure members are receiving coverage for safe and effective care. The company noted it is ""continually taking action to simplify and modernize the prior authorization process."" That includes reducing the number of services and procedures that require prior authorization and exempting qualified provider groups from needing to submit prior authorization requests for certain services. An emerging startup ecosystem Sheldon Cooper | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images While UnitedHealthcare is not the only insurer facing criticism from patients, Thompson's killing in December reinforced the company's unique position in the public eye. Thousands of people took to social media to express outrage toward the company, sharing examples of their own struggles. The public's hostile reaction to Thompson's death did not surprise many industry insiders. Alicia Graham, co-founder and chief operating officer of the startup Claimable, said Thompson's murder was ""a horrible crime."" She also acknowledged that anger has been bubbling up in various online health communities ""for years."" Claimable is one of several startups trying to address pain points within insurance. It's not an easy corner of the market to enter, and many of these companies, including Claimable, have been using the AI boom to their advantage. Claimable, founded in 2024, said it helps patients challenge denials by submitting customized, AI-generated appeal letters on their behalf. The company can submit appeals for conditions such as migraines and certain pediatric and autoimmune diseases, though Graham said it is expanding those offerings quickly. Many patients aren't aware that they have a right to appeal, and those who do can spend hours combing through records to draft one, Graham said. If patients are eligible to submit an appeal letter through Claimable, she said they can often do so in minutes. Each appeal costs users $39.95 plus shipping, according to the company's website. ""A lot of patients are afraid, a lot of patients are frustrated, a lot of patients are confused about the process, so what we've tried to do is make it all as easy as possible,"" Graham told CNBC. Some experts have warned about the possibility of health-care ""bot wars,"" where all parties are using AI to try to gain an edge. Mike Desjadon, CEO of the startup Anomaly, said he's concerned about the potential for an AI arms race in the sector, but he remains optimistic. Anomaly, founded in 2020, uses AI to help providers determine what insurers are and aren't paying for in advance of care, he said. ""I run a technology company and I want to win, and I want our customers to win, and that's all very true, but at the same time, I'm a citizen and a patient and a husband and a father and a taxpayer, and I just want health care to be rational and be paid for appropriately,"" Desjadon told CNBC. Dr. Jeremy Friese, founder and CEO of the startup Humata Health, said patients tend to interact with insurers only once something goes wrong, which contributes to their frustrations. Requirements such as prior authorization can be a ""huge black box"" for patients, but they're also cumbersome for doctors, he said. Friese said his business was inspired by his work as an interventional radiologist. In 2017, he co-founded a prior-authorization company called Verata Health, which was acquired by the now-defunct health-care AI startup Olive. Friese bought back his technology and founded his latest venture, Humata, in 2023. Humata uses AI to automate prior authorization for all specialties and payers, Friese said. The company primarily works with medium and large health systems, and it announced a $25 million funding round in June. ""There's just a lot of pent-up anger and angst, frankly, on all aspects of the health-care ecosystem,"" Friese told CNBC. The Change Healthcare cyberattack UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on May 1, 2024. Kent Nishimura | Getty Images UnitedHealth Group also set a grim record last year that did little to help public perception. The company's subsidiary Change Healthcare suffered a cyberattack that affected around 190 million Americans, the largest reported health-care data breach in U.S. history. Change Healthcare offers payment and revenue cycle management tools, as well as other solutions, such as electronic prescription software. In 2022, it merged with UnitedHealth Group's Optum unit, which touches more than 100 million patients in the U.S. In February 2024, a ransomware group called Blackcat breached part of Change Healthcare's information technology network. UnitedHealth Group isolated and disconnected the affected systems ""immediately upon detection"" of the threat, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but the ensuing disruption rocked the health-care sector. Money stopped flowing while the company's systems were offline, so a major revenue source for thousands of providers across the U.S. screeched to a halt. Some doctors pulled thousands of dollars out of their personal savings to keep their practices afloat. ""It was and remains the largest and most consequential cyberattack against health care in history,"" John Riggi, the national advisor for cybersecurity and risk at the American Hospital Association, told CNBC. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that blocks victims from accessing their computer files, systems and networks, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Ransomware groups such as Blackcat, which are often based in countries such as Russia, China and North Korea, will deploy this software, steal sensitive data and then demand a payment for its return. Ransomware attacks within the health-care sector have climbed in recent years, in part because patient data is valuable and relatively easy for cybercriminals to exploit, said Steve Cagle, CEO of the health-care cybersecurity and compliance firm Clearwater. ""It's been a very lucrative and successful business for them,"" Cagle told CNBC. ""Unfortunately, we'll continue to see that type of activity until something changes."" UnitedHealth Group paid the hackers a $22 million ransom to try to protect patients' data, then-CEO Witty said during a Senate hearing in May 2024. Sheldon Cooper | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images In March 2024, UnitedHealth Group launched a temporary funding assistance program to help providers with short-term cash flow. The program got off to a rocky start, several doctors told CNBC, and the initial deposits did not cover their mounting expenses. UnitedHealth Group ultimately paid out more than $9 billion to providers in 2024, according to the company's fourth-quarter earnings report in January. Witty said in his congressional testimony that providers would only be required to repay the loans when ""they, not me, but they confirm that their cash flow is normalized."" Almost a year later, however, the company is aggressively going after borrowers, demanding they ""immediately repay"" their outstanding balances, according to documents viewed by CNBC and providers who received funding. Some groups have been asked to repay hundreds of thousands of dollars in a matter of days, according to documents viewed by CNBC. A spokesperson for Change Healthcare confirmed to CNBC in April that the company has started recouping the loans. We continue to work with providers on repayment and other options, and continue to reach out to those providers that have not been responsive to previous calls or email requests for more information,"" the spokesperson said. The pressure for repayment drew more ire toward UnitedHealth Group on social media, and some providers told CNBC that dealing with the company was a ""very frustrating experience."" The vast majority of Change Healthcare's services have been restored over the last year, but three products are still listed as ""partial service available,"" according to UnitedHealth's cyberattack response website.

The S&P 500 ended Thursday near flat, as investors grappled with fears of rising rates and worries about a ballooning U.S. deficit. The 30-year Treasury yield hit its highest since October 2023 as lawmakers passed a bill that investors fear could worsen the U.S. deficit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.35 points, closing at 41,859.09. The S&P 500 lost 0.04% and ended at 5,842.01, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.28% and settled at 18,925.73. In a party line vote early Thursday, House members approved the bill that includes lower taxes and additional military spending. The measure - which now goes to the Senate - could increase the U.S. government's debt by trillions and raise the deficit at a time when fears of a flare-up in inflation due to Trump tariffs are already weighing on bond prices and boosting yields. The Congressional Budget Office puts the price tag for bill at nearly $4 trillion. ""Short term, the tax bill is good for the economy. It is going to boost GDP growth in 2026. It reduces taxes for lots of people, it increases spending, especially on defense, and so those things are stimulative to the economy and are going to boost GDP growth,"" said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, in an interview with CNBC. However, he noted that in the longer term, the measure adds to the deficit and it's bad news for the market. ""Yields are going higher, which means prices are going down because Treasurys are becoming incrementally less appealing and trustworthy, as our budget deficit stays extremely high for a very long period of time with no signs of it going back to normal,"" Ellerbroek added. The 30-year Treasury bond yield on Thursday traded at levels not seen since 2023, climbing as high as 5.161%, before retreating later in the session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield also backed off its high of the day. The increase in long-term rates, which are benchmarks for consumer loans, could pressure an economy already feeling the weight of Trump's recently implemented universal tariffs. A poor auction for 20-year Treasury debt helped fuel the spike in yields and the sell-off in stocks on Wednesday. Investors' appetite for Treasurys could worsen if this bill passes the Senate."

Ivana Magovcevic-Liebisch, Ph.D., J.D., President and CEO of Vigil, said, ""Sanofi's development capabilities, therapeutic expertise, global footprint, and financial strength provide the greatest opportunity to further the development of VG-3927 for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease and potentially bring this important and differentiated therapy to those struggling with the immense burden of this disease."" Houman Ashrafian, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Research and Development of Sanofi, added, ""TREM2 represents a compelling target at the intersection of immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, particularly in people living with Alzheimer's because they face devastating cognitive decline with limited treatment options."" In April 2025, Vigil Neuroscience presented new data from its oral small molecule program, featuring its lead candidate, VG-3927, through two oral presentations at the AD/PD 2025 International Conference in Austria. At that time, Ivana Magovcevic-Liebisch said the two presentations highlight the strong potential of VG-3927. This oral, brain-penetrant TREM2 agonist showed positive results in Phase 1, with good safety, tolerability, and drug activity. She further explained that VG-3927 could offer a new way to treat Alzheimer's disease by targeting more than just amyloid buildup. Vigil plans to begin Phase 2 trials of VG-3927, the only once-daily oral TREM2 agonist currently in clinical development, later this year. Vigil's monoclonal antibody program, Iluzanebart (VGL101), is excluded from the acquisition by Sanofi. Before the transaction is finalized, the exclusive license agreement with Amgen for VGL101 will be terminated, and the rights to the program will be returned to Amgen, its original licensor."

The term refers to a nightmare combination of economic stagnation or even a recession and rising inflation. It's a very tricky scenario for central banks to navigate: raising interest rates to rein in inflation risks stifling growth and pushing up unemployment, but cutting interest rates to juice the economy could stoke inflation. ""There's a chance that (we'll) have stagflation (in the US),"" Dimon told Bloomberg Television in Shanghai, China, Thursday. The billionaire stressed that he was not making a prediction but that ""we have to be prepared for something like that."" ""Global fiscal deficits are inflationary. I think the remilitarization of the world is inflationary. The restructuring of trade is inflationary. And this is not all an American thing,"" he added. Dimon's comments come as President Donald Trump is trying to pass a ""big, beautiful bill"" through Congress that would slash taxes for Americans - a move the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would add trillions of dollars to the federal deficit over the coming years. On Monday, Dimon told investors he believes that the odds of stagflation are likely twice that of what others have projected. He also said that the full effects of Trump's tariffs have yet to be felt and that markets are exhibiting an ""extraordinary amount of complacency"" in the face of those and other risks. The US Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate steady since January as Trump's erratic trade policy has injected a huge amount of uncertainty into the world's largest economy - in turn provoking robust criticism from Trump who would like to see rates fall. In his Thursday interview at JPMorgan's China Summit, Dimon disagreed with the idea that the Fed was operating in a ""sweet spot."" ""The (US) economy has been doing well... we've effectively been in a soft landing,"" he said, referring to the central bank's success in bringing inflation down without tipping the economy into recession. But he added: ""That does not tell you what the future's going to be."" Dimon said the Fed is ""doing the right thing"" by waiting to see how the various inflationary factors, including America's fiscal hole, affect the US economy before deciding whether to cut or raise rates. ""They also have to follow the facts,"" he said. Last week, credit rating agency Moody's downgraded America's perfect credit score, citing its ballooning government debt burden."

Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren also criticized the bill for overlooking the Trump family&#x27;s connections to World Liberty Financial&#x27;s USD1 stablecoin. Last week, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theblock.co/post/354624/world-liberty-financial-rebuts-senate-democrats-probe-usd1-stablecoin-trump-crypto-ties&quot;&gt;alleged&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump-linked DeFi project could allow foreign governments and others to enrich and compromise the president.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sacks did not directly respond to those concerns, predominantly on the Democrat side of the aisle, that there aren&#x27;t enough safeguards to keep President Trump and his family from benefitting from the legislation, instead emphasizing the bill&#x27;s bipartisan support. &quot;I think 15 Democrats voted for the bill to pass this key procedural threshold of cloture, which means there&#x27;ll be no filibuster against the bill,&quot; he said,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;We have every expectation now that it&#x27;s going to pass,&quot; Sacks added. &quot;I think the reason it&#x27;s going to pass is because stablecoins offer a more efficient, cheaper, smoother payment system, new payment rails for the U.S. economy. It also extends the dominance of the dollar online. I think for all these reasons, the stablecoin bill is going to pass, and it&#x27;s going to pass with significant bipartisan support.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sacks, whose remit also covers artificial intelligence policy, closed the interview by emphasizing that the U.S. administration would help support the infrastructure, power capacity, and innovation required to win the AI race. &quot;If we don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll be very bad for our economy.

Still, their first reaction was shock. ""It was like disbelief. And then it was just like fury, honestly, like how could they have us working this, you know?,"" said the controller, who works in Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which manages the airspace around Newark. They asked NPR not to use their name because they're not authorized to speak publicly and are worried about retaliation from their employer, the Federal Aviation Administration. ""We had had other outages prior to that point that demonstrated to us that our equipment was unreliable,"" the controller said in an interview this week. Those earlier incidents were alarming enough, the controller says, that controllers handling Newark asked the FAA to reduce the number of planes in the airspace. Sponsor Message ""We would ask them for less airplanes, and they would tell us no,"" they said. Now regulators are taking those concerns more seriously. This week the FAA capped the number of flights in and out of Newark at 56 per hour, a cut of about 15%. The new limits in Newark come after a harrowing month for travelers at one of the nation's busiest airports - and for the air traffic controllers who work the airspace around it. Radar and communication systems stopped working on at least three occasions, once for as long as 90 seconds, since April 28. The incidents have raised big questions about how the air traffic control mess in Newark got as bad as it did, and what it will take to fix an aging air traffic control system. And they prompted one air traffic controller to share their perspective in an interview with NPR this week. ""We're overstretched, we're understaffed, we're all stressed out. Our equipment doesn't work,"" the controller said. ""It's just not sustainable."" toggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy insists that limiting that pace of arrivals and departures in Newark will help. ""I believe the system is safe. There are multiple redundancies throughout the system that keep people safe,"" Duffy said during a Senate committee hearing last week. ""The key is not efficiency, the key is safety."" Sponsor Message In a sense, Newark is suffering from the same problems as the entire air traffic control system in the U.S.: decades of underinvestment in aging communications systems, and a staffing shortage of more than 3,000 air traffic controllers nationwide. But according to this controller, the recent problems are also unique to Newark - and many of them stem from the way the FAA moved the air traffic controllers who work the Newark airspace from Long Island, N.Y., to Philadelphia last year. ""We have issues FAA-wide. Those things are true. However this particular situation was a self-inflicted FAA decision to move us out of New York. We did not have these issues when we were in New York,"" they said. ""So you're trying to make it seem like, well, the FAA is in shambles and that's why Newark is this problem. No, Newark is this problem because you moved us out of New York without a real plan."" The FAA did not respond directly to the controller's allegations. But the agency says moving control of the Newark airspace to Philadelphia was necessary to keep up with demand in some of the nation's busiest airspace. ""This has been meant to get us healthy on a staffing level,"" said Michael Whitaker, former FAA administrator during the Biden administration, said at a press conference in November . ""With this move, we're able to relieve the stress in New York and improve controller staffing levels by recruiting and training controllers in Philadelphia."" For years, the FAA had been talking about moving control of the Newark airspace out of New York TRACON on Long Island, which handles the airspace around LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport, the other two major airports in the area. The FAA was having trouble hiring enough controllers to staff the facility on Long Island, due in part to the low rate of training success there, according to the agency. And the controllers who did work there consistently earned a lot of money through overtime. toggle caption Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Images Eventually, the FAA decided to move the air traffic controllers who handle Newark to Philadelphia, where the cost of living is lower and it would be easier to recruit. The agency offered bonuses of $100,000 to incentivize controllers to move. Still, some did not like the idea because they had friends and families in New York. Sponsor Message ""I get it in a sense why they're like, well, let's move it somewhere else,"" the controller told NPR. ""But I feel like the way that they went about it was really haphazard. It was really reckless, honestly. And it was also a little bit cruel to us as people, as the controllers who they moved."" There had been 33 certified air traffic controllers working the Newark airspace on Long Island, and two dozen of them made the move last summer to Philadelphia. From the beginning, there were concerns about how the move would work from a technical standpoint, one of the controllers told NPR. ""It didn't seem like they had thought out all of the elements of the move and how things would work fully because, you know, we would start asking them questions. Well, what about the equipment? How are you hooking this up? How is this going to work? And we did not get satisfying answers,"" they said. Still, the controller says they tried to keep an open mind. But even they were surprised at how badly it's gone. ""It's been worse of a disaster than even the most cynical people in the union predicted,"" the controller said. ""It's been a debacle."" The FAA says it is working on an expedited plan to install new fiber optic lines to replace the copper wires that are still in use in some places, and is also adding new backup systems to help with technical issues in Newark. toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Secretary Duffy has announced a plan to ""supercharge"" the hiring of new air traffic controllers, but the reality is it takes years to train them. And the shortage of controllers is especially acute in Philadelphia , where some controllers have taken trauma leave to recover from the psychological impact of the recent outages. ""We are at our limit. Our families are telling us, you need a break. Like our friends are telling us, you don't seem OK. We are all at that point,"" said the controller we spoke to. ""You can tell that people are breaking down. You can see the misery when people show up to work. There have been grown men crying in the parking lot on their breaks because of our work conditions."" Sponsor Message The combination of technical outages and staffing shortages has forced airlines to cancel, delay or redirect hundreds of flights. The problems have disproportionately affected United Airlines, which has a major hub in Newark. And United CEO Scott Kirby put some of the blame on air traffic controllers in a public message to customers . ""Unfortunately, the technology issues were compounded as over 20% of the FAA controllers for EWR walked off the job,"" Kirby wrote. The union that represents air traffic controllers disputes that any walked off the job, saying they are entitled to take time off before going back to work on equipment that failed. ""What we must do now is modernize the system, give the air traffic controllers the equipment they deserve, and not blame them for the issues that they're seeing,"" said Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, in an interview. Other air traffic controllers took issue with Kirby's comments, too. ""I don't expect for anyone to weep over us,"" said the Newark airspace controller who spoke to NPR. ""We get paid more than a lot of people get paid to do this. But we are under immense stress every single day."" toggle caption Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images Since these recent outages, aviation experts have insisted it is safe to fly in and out of Newark. But Transportation Secretary Duffy says he'd advised his wife to change her flight from Newark to LaGuardia - not because it was unsafe, Duffy said, but because she needed to get where she was going on time. The Newark controller told NPR they would not use the airport, either. ""My best friend asked me the other day, like, 'I got a Newark flight, is it going to be fine?,'"" they said. ""I was like, no, don't fly out of Newark. Like, at the very least you're going to be delayed. But no, like, I've had to book flights and Newark is the cheapest and most convenient option, nine times out of ten. And I'm not going to do it."""
FDA requires Covid vaccine makers to expand warning about risk of rare heart inflammation - CNN,business,The US Food and Drug Administration will now require Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to use expanded warning labels with more information about the risk of a rare heart condition after vaccination.,Jen Christensen,CNN,2025-05-22T01:59:00+00:00,The US Food and Drug Administration will now require Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to use expanded warning labels with more information about the risk of a rare heart condition after vaccination.

The vaccines' previous labels warned about the risk of a heart condition called myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside the heart, which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website says is rare but possible after vaccination. The new labels will expand that warning to certain age groups. Research has consistently shown that the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and millions of people have gotten them without serious incident. Some studies have found that Covid-19 infection itself carries a higher risk of myocarditis or pericarditis than the vaccine does. The CDC last month told its independent vaccine advisers that research showed Covid-19 vaccinations from 2020 through 2022 showed a statistically significant increased risk of myocarditis. The incidents were rare, however, and ""there is no increased risk observed with the doses administered in subsequent years,"" the agency said. In the rare case that someone did develop heart inflammation after vaccination, the CDC told the advisers, acute myocarditis typically resolves quickly. The vaccines already carried warnings that the highest risk of these heart problems was observed in males between ages 18 and 24 for the Moderna vaccine and 12 to 17 for Pfizer's; the new warnings for both vaccines will be for males age 16 to 25. In letters to Pfizer and Moderna that were dated April 17 and are now posted online, the agency says analysis of commercial health insurance claims data shows that there were eight cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million vaccine doses given to people ages 6 months through 64 years. Cases were more common among males ages 16 through 25 within seven days of vaccination, but they were still rare, with about 38 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million doses among this group. A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that the move was intended to increase ""radical transparency."" Neither Pfizer nor Moderna responded to requests for comment. The vaccines were developed during the first Trump administration and underwent what the CDC says was ""the most intensive safety analysis in US history,"" and the agency continues to monitor vaccine administration data for effectiveness and any potential problems. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has falsely claimed that the Covid-19 vaccine was ""the deadliest vaccine ever made."" In a US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, claimed that the Biden administration downplayed the risks of the vaccine and delayed getting information about those risks to the public. One witness, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a family physician, said in his testimony the US vaccine safety monitoring systems worked ""exactly as intended"" by detecting rare cases of myocarditis. ""The data were made public, warnings were updated, and clinical guidance was revised accordingly,"" Green said. ""Despite this, some continue to promote misleading interpretations, unverified claims or anecdotes to suggest that vaccines are broadly unsafe."" The FDA has taken recent steps to limit Covid-19 vaccines for certain groups. On Tuesday, the FDA said it would change the type of evidence it will accept from vaccine manufacturers to approve updated Covid shots, which may limit who is eligible for updated shots. The vaccines are expected to be be available in the fall, but only for adults 65 and older and people with underlying conditions that put them at a higher risk for severe Covid-19 infection. In an editorial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Vinay Prasad, the new director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said there's not enough evidence that healthy children and adults get clinically meaningful benefit from regular Covid-19 shots, and officials want to see more placebo-controlled trials, particularly in adults 50 to 64, before recommending the shots for other groups. On Thursday, the FDA's vaccine advisers - the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee - will meet to discuss the coronavirus strain selection for this fall's Covid-19 vaccines.

As The Guardian reports, nurse practitioners say that UnitedHealth pressed them to change patients' status to ""do not resuscitate"" - even after those same patients had ""clearly expressed a desire that all available treatments be used to keep them alive."" ""They're pretending to make it look like it's in the best interest of the member,"" one practitioner told the British newspaper. ""But it's really not."" UnitedHealth also allegedly tried to prevent patients from transferring hospitals, risking their health further. While the company has denied the allegations, the reporting paints an alarming picture of the state of healthcare in the United States, where insurance is treated much the same way as a tech company trying to maximize profits while cutting costs. UnitedHealth already has a lengthy track record of finding creative ways to deny people healthcare coverage, including deploying an AI that automatically denied and overrode claims for elderly patients. The company has attracted particular controversy after its CEO was murdered in December, in an apparent act of lethal anger at the injustices of a notoriously greedy and deficient system. The company has had a miserable year since then. Its shares have dropped almost 40 percent year to date, following a flood of damning reports. Following The Guardian's reporting today, UnitedHealth's stock price slid by more than six percent. The company has also been the subject of criminal and civil investigations into its practices, including medicare fraud, as Reuters reports. Last week, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty abruptly resigned, citing ""personal reasons"" and drawing even more scrutiny over the company's operations. Whether the departure had anything to do with a continuous flood of bad press remains unclear. According to a whistleblower lawsuit cited by the Guardian, staffers at nursing homes were directly incentivized to leak sensitive resident records so that UnitedHealth sales teams could solicit their plans to them and their families. A patient who showed key symptoms of having suffered a stroke, for instance, was denied care by a remote and underqualified UnitedHealth employee, who suggested she was suffering from a less serious condition, according to UnitedHealth logs and records obtained by the newspaper. The delays caused by healthcare practitioners waiting to hear back from the insurer led to the patient's health deteriorating further. Per The Guardian, there have been countless other instances like it. In short, UnitedHealth seems far interested in cutting costs than ensuring people in senior homes stay healthy. ""How many of those people were further harmed because they never received the care that they needed?"" former UnitedHealth nurse practitioner turned whistleblower Maxwell Ollivant told The Guardian. ""When you just look at the percentage reductions in hospitalizations, it doesn't say anything about patient outcomes.""

The suit was filed by a mother from Florida, Megan Garcia, who alleges that her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III fell victim to a Character.AI chatbot that pulled him into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Meetali Jain of the Tech Justice Law Project, one of the attorneys for Garcia, said the judge's order sends a message that Silicon Valley ""needs to stop and think and impose guardrails before it launches products to market."" The suit against Character Technologies, the company behind Character.AI, also names individual developers and Google as defendants. It has drawn the attention of legal experts and AI watchers in the U.S. and beyond, as the technology rapidly reshapes workplaces, marketplaces and relationships despite what experts warn are potentially existential risks. ""The order certainly sets it up as a potential test case for some broader issues involving AI,"" said Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky, a law professor at the University of Florida with a focus on the First Amendment and artificial intelligence. The lawsuit alleges that in the final months of his life, Setzer became increasingly isolated from reality as he engaged in sexualized conversations with the bot, which was patterned after a fictional character from the television show ""Game of Thrones."" In his final moments, the bot told Setzer it loved him and urged the teen to ""come home to me as soon as possible,"" according to screenshots of the exchanges. Moments after receiving the message, Setzer shot himself, according to legal filings. In a statement, a spokesperson for Character.AI pointed to a number of safety features the company has implemented, including guardrails for children and suicide prevention resources that were announced the day the lawsuit was filed. ""We care deeply about the safety of our users and our goal is to provide a space that is engaging and safe,"" the statement said. Attorneys for the developers want the case dismissed because they say chatbots deserve First Amendment protections, and ruling otherwise could have a ""chilling effect"" on the AI industry. In her order Wednesday, U.S. Senior District Judge Anne Conway rejected some of the defendants' free speech claims, saying she's ""not prepared"" to hold that the chatbots' output constitutes speech ""at this stage."" Conway did find that Character Technologies can assert the First Amendment rights of its users, who she found have a right to receive the ""speech"" of the chatbots. She also determined Garcia can move forward with claims that Google can be held liable for its alleged role in helping develop Character.AI. Some of the founders of the platform had previously worked on building AI at Google, and the suit says the tech giant was ""aware of the risks"" of the technology. ""We strongly disagree with this decision,"" said Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda. ""Google and Character AI are entirely separate, and Google did not create, design, or manage Character AI's app or any component part of it."" No matter how the lawsuit plays out, Lidsky says the case is a warning of ""the dangers of entrusting our emotional and mental health to AI companies."" ""It's a warning to parents that social media and generative AI devices are not always harmless,"" she said. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE - If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. ___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Boss Sam Altman said he was ""thrilled"" to be partnering with the man he called the ""greatest designer in the world"". OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is buying Sir Jony's startup, io, in a $6.5bn (4.7bn) deal. Mr Altman said he was excited to ""try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers"" together. Sir Jony - who designed the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad - will ""assume deep design and creative responsibilities"" across the company, the two firms said in an announcement. Re-imagining the computer AI software has made rapid advances in recent years, spearheaded by ChatGPT. But developing new hardware based around it has proved more of a challenge - with several recent attempts failing to interest consumers and attracting derision from reviewers. Mr Altman though has spoken of his confidence that this partnership can succeed where others have failed. ""I think we have the opportunity here to kind of completely re-imagine what it means to use a computer,"" he said in a video that accompanied the announcement. Sir Jony said he believed the world was on the ""brink of a new generation of technology"". It may not be long until this new ""family of devices"" from the pair make an impact. ""The first one we've been working on I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" said Sir Jony. Mr Altman said he has already tried out a prototype of a new device designed by Sir Jony and his team, and he thinks it is ""the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen"". 'A singular figure in the design world' Getty Images Some of the iconic Apple products designed by Jony Ive and his team - the iPod, the iMac and the iPhone Sir Jony worked for Apple for 27 years, helping to revive the company with groundbreaking products including the iPhone and iPod. He also designed the iMac in 1998 and the iPad in 2010. When Sir Jony left the company in 2019, Apple's CEO Tim Cook described him as ""a singular figure in the design world and his role in Apple's revival cannot be overstated"". Shares in Apple fell more than 2% following the news of his partnership with OpenAI. He left to found his own company, LoveFrom, which has worked with companies such as Airbnb and Moncler. In the announcement about the merger, it said LoveFrom had been ""quietly collaborating"" with OpenAI for two years. The idea for io, which Sir Jony founded last year with others, followed this partnership. ""It became clear that our ambitions to develop, engineer and manufacture a new family of products demanded an entirely new company,"" said Sir Jony and Mr Altman. OpenAI had a 23% stake in the start-up prior to Wednesday's announcement, according to US media. Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, told BBC News that it would be ""foolish to bet against Jony Ive, given his remarkable track record of delivering products that disrupt a market"". ""There is no question that OpenAI would love to have a direct relationship with its customers rather than delivering services via devices made by or powered by Apple, Google, or others,"" he added. Justin McGuirk, from the UK's Design Museum, said Sir Jony ""brings serious design credibility"". He said: ""If OpenAI want to take AI-based hardware to market, especially at a time when many are sceptical about the need for such things, it's going to have to be incredibly good.

FDA will approve COVID-19 vaccine only for older adults and high-risk groups – a public health expert explains the new rules - The Conversation,business,The FDA’s new framework for COVID-19 vaccines breaks from established procedure for how the government establishes vaccine guidelines.,Unknown,The Conversation Africa,2025-05-21T21:26:43+00:00,"On May 20, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration announced a new stance on who should receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

The agency said it would approve new versions of the vaccine only for adults 65 years of age and older as well as for people with one or more risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes. These risk factors include medical conditions such as asthma, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart disease and diabetes. However, healthy younger adults and children who fall outside of these groups may not be eligible to receive the COVID-19 shot this fall. Vaccine manufacturers will have to conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that the vaccine benefits low-risk groups. FDA Commissioner Martin Makary and the agency's head of vaccines, Vinay Prasad, described the new framework in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine and in a public webcast. The Conversation U.S. asked Libby Richards, a nursing professor involved in public health promotion, to explain why the changes were made and what they mean for the general public. Why did the FDA diverge from past practice? Until the May 20 announcement, getting a yearly COVID-19 vaccine was recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, regardless of their health risk. According to Makary and Prasad, the Food and Drug Administration is moving away from these universal recommendations and instead taking a risk-based approach based on its interpretation of public health trends - specifically, the declining COVID-19 booster uptake, a lack of strong evidence that repeated boosters improve health outcomes for healthy people and the fact that natural immunity from past COVID-19 infections is widespread. The FDA states it wants to ensure the vaccine is backed by solid clinical trial data, especially for low-risk groups. Was this a controversial decision or a clear consensus? The FDA's decision to adopt a risk-based framework for the COVID-19 vaccine aligns with the expected recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an advisory group of vaccine experts offering expert guidance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine policy, which is scheduled to meet in June 2025. But while this advisory committee was also expected to recommend allowing low-risk people to get annual COVID-19 vaccines if they want to, the FDA's policy will likely make that difficult. Although the FDA states that its new policy aims to promote greater transparency and evidenced-based decision-making, the change is controversial - in part because it circumvents the usual process for evaluating vaccine recommendations. The FDA is enacting this policy change by limiting its approval of the vaccine to high-risk groups, and it is doing so without any new data supporting its decision. Usually, however, the FDA broadly approves a vaccine based on whether it is safe and effective, and decisions on who should be eligible to receive it are left to the CDC, which receives research-based guidance from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Additionally, FDA officials point to Canada, Australia and some European countries that limit vaccine recommendations to older adults and other high-risk people as a model for its revised framework. But vaccine strategies vary widely, and this more conservative approach has not necessarily proven superior. Also, those countries have universal health care systems and have a track record of more equitable access to COVID-19 care and better COVID-19 outcomes. Another question is how health officials' positions on COVID-19 vaccines affect public perception. Makary and Prasad noted that COVID-19 vaccination campaigns may have actually eroded public trust in vaccination. But some vaccine experts have expressed concerns that limiting COVID-19 vaccine access might further fuel vaccine hesitancy because any barrier to vaccine access can reduce uptake and hinder efforts to achieve widespread immunity. What conditions count as risk factors? The New England Journal of Medicine article includes a lengthy list of conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 and notes that about 100 million to 200 million people will fall into this category and will thus be eligible to get the vaccine. Pregnancy is included. Some items on the list, however, are unclear. For example, the list includes asthma, but the data that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 is scant. Also on the list is physical inactivity, which likely applies to a vast swath of Americans and is difficult to define. Studies have found links between regular physical activity and reduced risk of severe COVID-19 infection, but it's unclear how health care providers will define and measure physical inactivity when assessing a patient's eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines. Most importantly, the list leaves out an important group - caregivers and household members of people at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection. This omission leaves high-risk people more vulnerable to exposure to COVID-19 from healthy people they regularly interact with. Multiple countries the new framework refers to do include this group. Why is the FDA requiring new clinical trials? According to the FDA, the benefits of multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccines for healthy adults are currently unproven. It's true that studies beyond the fourth vaccine dose are scarce. However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the vaccine is effective at preventing the risk of severe COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death in low-risk adults and children. Receiving multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccines has also been shown to reduce the risk of long COVID. The FDA is requiring vaccine manufactures to conduct additional large randomized clinical trials to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 boosters for healthy adults and children. These trials will primarily test whether the vaccines prevent symptomatic infections, and secondarily whether they prevent hospitalization and death. Such trials are more complex, costly and time-consuming than the more common approach of testing for immunological response. This requirement will likely delay both the timeliness and the availability of COVID-19 vaccine boosters and slow public health decision-making. Will low-risk people be able to get a COVID-19 shot? Not automatically. Under the new FDA framework, healthy adults who wish to receive the fall COVID-19 vaccine will face obstacles. Health care providers can administer vaccines ""off-label"", but insurance coverage is widely based on FDA recommendations. The new, narrower FDA approval will likely reduce both access to COVID-19 vaccines for the general public and insurance coverage for COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA's focus on individual risks and benefits may overlook broader public health benefits. Communities with higher vaccination rates have fewer opportunities to spread the virus. What about vaccines for children? High-risk children age 6 months and older who have conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 are still eligible for the vaccine under the new framework. As of now, healthy children age 6 months and older without underlying medical conditions will not have routine access to COVID-19 vaccines until further clinical trial data is available. Existing vaccines already on the market will remain available, but it is unclear how long they will stay authorized and how the change will affect childhood vaccination overall."
Windows 95 chime composer Brian Eno denounces Microsoft for its ties to Israeli government - The Verge,business,Brian Eno pledged to donate his earnings from creating the Windows ‘95 startup chime to people in Gaza.,Mia Sato,The Verge,2025-05-21T20:14:01+00:00,"Artist and musician Brian Eno - who also composed the iconic Windows 95 operating system startup chime - called on Microsoft today to ""suspend all services that support any operations that contribute to violations of international law,"" saying the company plays a role in ""surveillance, violence, and...","['microsoft', 'israeli', 'company', 'contracts', 'government']",https://www.theverge.com/news/671864/brian-eno-windows-95-chime-microsoft-israel-palestine-statement,"Artist and musician Brian Eno - who also composed the iconic Windows 95 operating system startup chime - called on Microsoft today to ""suspend all services that support any operations that contribute to violations of international law,"" saying the company plays a role in ""surveillance, violence, and destruction in Palestine."" It's the latest high-profile instance of the tech giant being pressed on its contracts with the Israeli government. ""I gladly took on the [Windows 95] project as a creative challenge and enjoyed the interaction with my contacts at the company,"" Eno wrote on Instagram. ""I never would have believed that the same company could one day be implicated in the machinery of oppression and war."" The musician - who was a member of the influential rock band Roxy Music and has also had a long, storied solo career - specifically called out Microsoft's contracts with Israel's Ministry of Defense. Microsoft acknowledged last week that it has contracts with the Israeli government for cloud and AI services, but claimed that an internal review conducted found ""no evidence"" that its tools were used to ""target or harm people"" in Gaza. [Media: https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ6ySBKNpEU/?img_index=1] Microsoft has been taken to task in recent weeks over its business dealings with the Israeli government specifically. The outcry over Microsoft's contracts relates to Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza following the October 7th, 2023, Hamas attack. Human rights groups, including commissions at the United Nations, have accused Israel of war crimes and genocidal acts in its military operation that has killed thousands; as of this month, the Gaza Health Ministry reported more than 52,000 deaths, though some researchers say that number could be as high as 109,000 people. Some of Microsoft's fiercest critics are its own employees opposed to the company's ties to Israel. Earlier this week during Microsoft's developer conference, multiple onstage events were disrupted, including CEO Satya Nadella's keynote speech on Monday. During the event, Microsoft employee Joe Lopez interrupted Nadella, yelling, ""How about you show Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?"" The following day, a protester described only as a ""Palestinian tech worker"" disrupted another executive's presentation. On Wednesday, protesters disrupted a third session - and in the commotion, Microsoft inadvertently revealed internal messages regarding Walmart's use of AI. [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Ak5VgyEoc] In April, Microsoft employee Ibtihal Aboussad disrupted a 50th-anniversary event, calling Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman ""a war profiteer."" Another employee disrupted a second Microsoft event the same day. The acts of protest were organized by the No Azure for Apartheid group, which calls for Microsoft to terminate contracts with the Israeli government and endorse a permanent ceasefire, among other demands. Aboussad was fired from the company; the second protester, Vaniya Agrawal, was dismissed early after putting in her resignation. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eno, a longtime critic of the Israeli government who's backed pro-Palestine efforts, said on Instagram he would use his original earnings from the Windows 95 startup chime to help ""the victims of the attacks on Gaza."""

""The Department will continue to use its unique tools, authorities, and partnerships to disrupt malicious cyber operations and criminal networks,"" said Sue J. Bai, head of the Justice Department's National Security Division. ""Today's disruption is another instance where our prosecutors, agents, and private sector partners came together to protect us from the persistent cybersecurity threats targeting our country. We are grateful for their work and dedication."" ""Malware like LummaC2 is deployed to steal sensitive information such as user login credentials from millions of victims in order to facilitate a host of crimes, including fraudulent bank transfers and cryptocurrency theft,"" said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. ""Today's announcement demonstrates that the Justice Department is resolved to use court-ordered disruptions like this one to protect the public from the theft of their personal information and their assets. The Department is also committed to working with and appreciates the efforts of the private sector to safeguard the public from cybercrime."" ""The FBI is committed to disrupting the key services that cyber criminals rely on,"" said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of FBI's Cyber Division. ""That's why, with our partners, we took action against the most popular infostealer service available in online criminal markets, which is responsible for millions of attacks against victims. Thanks to partnerships with the private sector, we were able to disrupt the LummaC2 infrastructure and seize user panels. Together, we are making it harder, and more painful, for cyber criminals to operate."" As alleged in the affidavits filed in support of the government's seizure warrants, the administrators of LummaC2 used the seized websites to distribute LummaC2, an information-stealing malware, to their affiliates and other cyber criminals. According to court documents, common targets for cybercriminals using malware like LummaC2 include browser data, autofill information, login credentials for accessing email and banking services, as well as cryptocurrency seed phrases, which permit access to virtual currency wallets. As alleged in the affidavits, the FBI has identified at least 1.7 million instances where LummaC2 was used to steal this type of information. The government's affidavit further alleges that the seized domains, also referred to as user panels, served as login pages for the LummaC2 malware, allowing credentialed users and administrators to access and deploy LummaC2. On May 19, 2025, the government seized two domains. On May 20, 2025, as detailed in court documents, the LummaC2 administrators informed their users of three new domains that they had set up to host the user panel. The next day, the government then seized those three domains. The seizure of these domains by the government will prevent the owners and cybercriminals from using the websites to access LummaC2 to compromise computers and steal victim information. Individuals who now visit the websites will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by the Justice Department, including the FBI. Concurrent with today's actions and consistent with the Department's approach to public-private operational coordination, Microsoft announced an independent civil action to take down 2,300 internet domains also claimed to be used by the LummaC2 actors or their proxies. FBI's Dallas Field Office is investigating the case. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas, the National Security Division's National Security Cyber Section, and the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are handling the case. The U.S. Department of State's Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, offers a reward of up to $10 million for information on foreign government-linked individuals participating in certain malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Here's what to do toggle caption Richard Hamilton Smith/Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is recalling cucumbers across the country over a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than two dozen people in multiple states. On Monday, the FDA announced a recall for cucumbers grown by South Florida-based Bedner Growers between April 29 and May 19. The FDA says Fresh Start Produce Sales distributed them to retailers, distribution centers, wholesalers and food service distributors nationwide, making people sick from California to Kansas to New York - and it is unclear exactly where else they may have ended up. ""Cucumbers may have been sold individually or in smaller packages, with or without a label that may not bear the same brand, product name, or best by date,"" the agency said. Sponsor Message The cucumbers in question have been linked to what the FDA calls a ""multistate outbreak"" of Salmonella Montevideo, a bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. As of Tuesday, the cucumbers have made 26 people sick, nine of whom required hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The cases are spread out across 15 states: Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The agency says investigators conducting a follow-up inspection in April collected an environmental sample from Bedner Growers that was positive for the disease and matched recent clinical samples from people who got sick. ""FDA's traceback investigation has identified Bedner Growers, Inc. as the common grower of cucumbers in this current outbreak,"" it said. Acknowledging that salmonella is a ""serious health concern,"" Bedner Growers said in a statement that it is initiating the recall ""in an abundance of caution, and out of deep respect for the public health."" Symptoms of salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps and vomiting. They usually start 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food and can last four to seven days. While many people typically recover on their own within a few days, diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration that requires medical attention. Sponsor Message The FDA says anyone who has symptoms of a salmonella infection, especially after eating cucumbers, should report them - and seek care - from their medical provider. What should shoppers do? The FDA and CDC are working with state and local authorities to investigate the outbreak. They warn that people with cucumbers already in their fridge should err on the side of caution. ""If you cannot tell if your cucumber was grown by Bedner Growers, throw it away,"" the FDA says. ""When eating out over the next week, ask if cucumbers were from Bedner Growers or Fresh Start Produce Sales, Inc."" Consumers, restaurants and retailers who have already handled potentially contaminated cucumbers should carefully sanitize any surfaces or containers that they may have touched. The FDA instructs restaurants, retailers and distributors that may have purchased the cucumbers between April 29 and May 19 to notify their customers about the potential health concerns and sanitize any areas - including bulk bins - that the vegetables touched. In general, the CDC recommends following several food safety tips to try to prevent food poisoning. It advises people to wash their hands, utensils and surfaces often; rinse fruits and vegetables under running water before eating or peeling them; keep food that won't be cooked separate from raw meat and poultry; and refrigerate perishable food within two hours - or one hour if the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. It says food should be thawed in refrigerators, not on countertops. Food scientists told NPR that when washing produce, it is not necessary - and could even be counterproductive - to use soap or let it soak in a bowl of water. Peeling produce might reduce the risk of consuming bacteria, but is not a guarantee. Where might the cucumbers be? According to the FDA's outbreak map, the states with the most illness reports are Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, home of Bedner Growers. Sponsor Message The FDA says some of the affected cucumbers were previously available for sale at Bedner's Farm Fresh Market's three Florida locations; Boynton Beach, Delray Beach and West Palm Beach. A spokesperson for Bedner Growers told NPR on Wednesday that the farmers markets have ""already recalled and eliminated all possibly contaminated cucumbers."" ""The current products you'll find today at the markets are completely unaffected by this recall,"" the company added. The FDA says it is aware that the contaminated cucumbers are available ""at both restaurant and retail locations,"" and is still working to trace them. Fresh Start Produce Sales told NPR in an email that it ""has notified all its affected wholesale and regional distribution center customers and asked them to provide their customers with recall instructions, including immediately notifying any consumer point-of-purchase locations such as retail stores and restaurants."" The FDA says the products purchased by distributors, restaurants, and retailers were labeled either as supers, selects or plains. How unusual is this outbreak? The CDC estimates that salmonella causes about 1.35 million infections in the U.S. each year, mostly through contaminated food. Salmonella infection is one of the leading causes of foodborne illness, and of hospitalizations and deaths linked to foodborne illness. The CDC says it is more common in the summer, with warmer temperatures and unrefrigerated food. Raw meat, seafood and poultry - particularly chicken - are a common culprit, as are raw or undercooked eggs. But fresh produce can also cause infections, for example, if they are washed during processing with water contaminated with salmonella. Cucumbers specifically have been the subject of several major salmonella recalls in recent years. A June 2024 outbreak sickened 551 people across 34 states and Washington, D.C., and the CDC recalled Mexican cucumbers in November after 68 people got sick. In fact, the FDA eventually determined that Bedner Growers was one of several likely sources of that summer outbreak - which is why it was collecting follow-up samples from the company last month."

Its sales slumped by 5.7% in the three months to May, at a time when the company also faced a backlash following a previous decision to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) targets. Bosses declined to confirm any potential price rises due to higher import taxes, saying raising prices could be a ""last resort."" Brian Cornell, chief executive of Target, said pricing decisions would depend on the retailer's efforts to source more products in the US and reduce its reliance on China. ""That is going to play a very important role,"" he said following the company's results. Unlike its rival Walmart, which generates the bulk of its revenues from selling grocery items like bananas, milk, toilet paper, and shampoo, Target's big sellers are mostly in non-essential goods, such as home furniture and beauty products. It sources the majority of such products from China, with 30% of its store-label goods from the country. That is down from 60% in 2017, but analysts have said the impact of higher import tariffs on goods from the country will be difficult to navigate. US President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on many countries since returning to the White House in an attempt to encourage businesses and consumers to buy more American-made goods. Trump hopes his policy will help boost US manufacturing and jobs but economists have warned it could lead to higher prices for customers. The US and China have agreed a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries, which has de-escalated the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, but US import taxes on Chinese remain higher than before at 30%."

Tariffs, inflation and lingering fears of a recession have left many Americans uneasy and pulling back on spending. Because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, a retreat would heighten the odds of contraction for the U.S. economy. With earnings from major retailers wrapping up it's become clear that the trade war launched by the Trump administration is impacting retailers in very different ways. Walmart earned a public rebuke from President Donald Trump after it said last week that it has already raised prices and will have to do so again this summer, right when the back-to-school shopping season kicks off. Trump told the retail giant that it should ""eat"" the additional costs created by his tariffs. Home Depot said Tuesday that it doesn't expect to raise prices because of tariffs, saying it has spent years diversifying the sources for the goods on its shelves. However, executive Billy Bastek said some products on Home Depot shelves now may disappear. ""There's items that we have that could potentially be impacted from a tariff that, candidly, we won't have going forward,"" Bastek said in a conference call with industry analysts. While retailers are sorting out how to best operate in a trade war, their customers are taking stock of their finances and the trends are not good. U.S. consumer sentiment declined slightly in May for the fifth straight month, surprising economists, as Americans increasingly worry that President Donald Trump's trade war will worsen inflation. The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, declined 2.7% on a monthly basis to 50.8, the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. The only lower reading was in June 2022. Since January, sentiment has tumbled nearly 30%. Here's a quick look at some poignant details from retailers reporting quarterly financial results Wednesday. Target Target's sales dropped more than anticipated in the first quarter, and the retailer warned they will slip for all of 2025 year as its customers, worried over the impact of tariffs and the economy, pull back on spending. Target also cut its annual sales projections. The company now expects a low-single digit decline for 2025 after previously projecting a 1% increase for sales. Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said during Target's conference call that the chain has been dealing with multiple issues impacting its business, including tariffs and declining consumer confidence. ""We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs and price is the very last resort,"" he said. ""Our strategy is to remain price competitive by leveraging the capabilities, long-standing relationships and the scale that set us apart from many of our retail peers."" TJX TJX Cos., parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores, has been pegged as one of the potential ""winners"" of the shifting trade landscape, as Americans try to save money. That appeared to be the case Wednesday as the company beat both revenue and profit expectations on Wall Street. And CEO Ernie Herrman said the second quarter is off to a strong start. ""I am convinced that our broad assortments of great brands and fashions, at compelling prices, will continue to be a tremendous draw for shoppers seeking value,"" he said. ""Further, I am confident that the strength, flexibility, and resiliency of our off-price business model will serve us well in today's macro environment, as it has throughout our long, successful history."" TJX maintained its fiscal 2026 forecast, which includes guidance for consolidated same-store sales to be up 2% to 3%. Lowe's Lowe's first-quarter sales declined slightly to $20.9 billion from $21.4 billion a year earlier, but that was better than Wall Street expected, with the U.S. housing market in a slump. The home improvement company reaffirmed its 2025 outlook for sales in a range of $83.5 to $84.5 billion. It still expects same-store sales to be flat to up 1%. President and CEO Marvin Ellison said during the company's conference call Wednesday that approximately 60% of Lowe's purchases originate in the U.S. and about 20% of its purchase volume is currently concentrated in China. ""Although we're pleased with this reduced dependency, we're not satisfied and we're working to accelerate our diversification efforts,"" he said of the company's product sourcing. Ellison added that Lowe's expects to continue to be competitive on its prices."
Retailers feel pressure to eat the price increases from tariffs - NPR,business,"From Target to Walmart, retailers are fighting two battles at once: a financial battle to keep costs low in the face of new tariffs, and a political one to avoid the president's wrath.",Alina Selyukh,NPR,2025-05-21T13:50:38+00:00,"Can retailers eat tariffs without price hikes?

Walmart, Target, Lowe's face pressure toggle caption Ted Shaffrey/AP Major American retailers are fighting two battles at once: As they grapple with the costly price impact from President Trump's sweeping tariffs, companies are struggling to talk about that impact publicly without enraging the White House or alienating their customers. Target on Wednesday became the latest retailer to lower its financial forecast for the year. It downplayed its plans for tariff-related price hikes. Lowe's executives, asked about tariffs and prices, also focused on plans to stay price-competitive and minimize the impact on shoppers. This follows Home Depot's update on Tuesday that it doesn't plan to raise prices broadly because of tariffs - though it acknowledged that some prices might go up and some items might disappear from store shelves altogether. Sponsor Message So far, all three have avoided the anger that the president and his administration have bestowed on Walmart, Mattel and, briefly, Amazon. Although Trump says foreign countries should pay for his tariffs, it's U.S. businesses that get the tariff bill when they claim their imported goods at the border. Under a current temporary deal, U.S. levies on Chinese imports are 30% instead of the previous 145%. All global imports face a new 10% tariff. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, last week warned it will have to raise prices as a result of tariffs, beginning as early as this month. Trump, in a social-media post, wrote that Walmart instead should ""EAT THE TARIFFS."" Walmart and its suppliers are already absorbing some of the costs of tariffs, CEO Doug McMillon has said. But Walmart cannot do that with the full amount ""given the magnitude of the tariffs,"" he said. Amazon, too, had faced criticism from the Trump administration after news reports that the retailer might display the costs of new tariffs on its low-cost marketplace called Amazon Haul. The White House called it ""hostile and political"" before Trump spoke with founder Jeff Bezos on the phone, and Amazon said displaying tariffs was never its plan to begin with. Sponsor Message Shortly after that, Trump threatened to put a 100% tariff on Barbie-maker Mattel after the company said it would raise prices on some toys due to tariffs. ""He won't sell one toy in the United States,"" Trump said. Following all that, Target executives reiterated that the chain was working hard to offset ""the vast majority"" of the tariffs. ""We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs, and price is the very last resort,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell told investors on an earnings call on Wednesday. The other levers include negotiating with suppliers, changing up product selection, shifting where items come from and reshuffling the timing of orders. Home Depot executives on Tuesday asserted that the chain wasn't looking at broad price hikes, but it might raise prices for individual items or switch up some product options if tariff costs prove too high. Similarly, its rival Lowe's said it would continue competing on price, keen to avoid losing shoppers to others with cheaper prices. ""We have tools that will allow us to manage this - and manage this in a way that we're going to minimize any impacts to our customers,"" Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison told investors on Wednesday's earnings call. ""In this environment, we're going to be as keenly focused on competing on price as we are every single day."" Lowe's, Home Depot and all other retailers face growing pressure from suppliers, also, as they too are wrestling with tariffs. For example, the tool maker Stanley Black & Decker last month already said it had raised its prices to account for new tariffs and planned another price increase later this year."

We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins.""The tariffs between the US and China have been paused, but retailers have cautioned that the high rates that remain in effect would materially impact their business operations, leading to higher expenses that they claim will have to be passed on to customers.Although the government has criticized corporations for raising prices and blamed them on trade policy, it has insisted that foreign producers will bear the expenses of any tariffs.Walmart joins number of firms warned against price hikeSpeaking to CNBC on Thursday, Walmart CFO John David Rainey asserted that the company aims to maintain lower costs than its rivals, particularly during a period when consumers are looking for deals.In order to do this, he stated that Walmart will bear a portion of the extra expenses associated with the tariff, and he anticipates other suppliers will follow suit.Also Read: Walmart boycott again?

Ford also announced last week that it plans to surge the cost of some of its vehicles.What Happens Next?Walmart has continued to project net sales of $674.5 billion, up from $643 billion, and operating profits of $29.5 billion for the entire year, despite its worries about the cost effects of tariffs.According to&nbsp;Rainey, consumers would probably be affected by the tariff-related price increases in late May and early June."

Customers have been unable to order online for almost a month, but can expect to see a gradual return to normal. ""We expect online disruption to continue throughout June and into July as we restart, then ramp up operations,"" said M&S. It estimates that the cyber-attack will hit this year's profits by around 300m - more than analysts had expected and the equivalent to a third of its profit - a sum that would only partly be covered by any insurance pay-out. ""Over the last few weeks, we have been managing a highly sophisticated and targeted cyber-attack, which has led to a limited period of disruption,"" said M&S chief executive Stuart Machin. The attack took place over the Easter weekend, initially affecting click-and-collect and contactless payments. A few days later M&S put a banner on its website apologising that online ordering was not available. Police are focusing on a notorious group of English-speaking hackers, known as Scattered Spider, the BBC has learned. The same group is believed to have been behind attacks on the Co-op and Harrods, but it was M&S that suffered the biggest impact. ""This incident is a bump in the road, and we will come out of this in better shape, and continue our plan to reshape M&S for customers, colleagues and shareholders,"" Mr Machin said. Mr Machin said his team had spotted ""suspicious activity"" during the key holiday weekend. M&S had run a cyberattack simulation last year he said, so ""was ready"". ""We were able to respond quickly and take the right actions immediately,"" he said. ""We knew who to call and how to put the business continuity plan into action."" The hackers used social engineering techniques, meaning they relied on human error or misjudgement, rather than a purely technological loophole. They gained access to M&S's system via a ""third party"" - a company working alongside the retailer - rather than accessing systems directly. Mr Machin said: ""We took our online system down ourselves to protect the website and customers."" In a media call on Wednesday, he did not respond to a question on whether the company had paid a ransom as part of the process. Lisa Forte, from cyber-security firm Red Goat, who advises companies following cyber-incidents, said she would not be surprised if any of the retailers involved in the recent wave of attacks had paid a ransom, since research from Barclays suggests 82% of businesses facing such an attack do. ""You wouldn't necessarily know,"" she said. If no ransom is paid, hackers will follow through with their threat to sell or release the data to ensure future threats are taken seriously, she points out. ""If the data never gets dumped, there's a high chance a ransom was paid."" She said M&S appeared to have handled the matter well overall, prioritising customers and reacting relatively quickly. Marks & Spencer Chief executive Stuart Machin is overseeing a turnaround programme at M&S"

(Jane Rosenberg/Reuters)REUTERS / Reuters The trial of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs wrapped up its second week on Thursday in Manhattan federal court, where rapper Kid Cudi testified about his relationship with Combs&#39;s ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in the sex trafficking case. Federal prosecutors say that for decades, Combs abused, threatened and coerced women to participate in marathon sexual encounters called &quot;freak offs&quot; and used his business empire, along with guns, kidnapping and arson, to conceal his crimes. The 55-year-old hip-hop mogul has been charged with sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. Kid Cudi - whose real name is Scott Mescudi - told the court that he started dating Ventura in 2011 when she told him that she and Combs had split up. Kid Cudi testified that after Combs found out he was seeing Ventura, Combs went looking for him and broke into his home. Kid Cudi also testified that his Porsche was later set on fire with a Molotov cocktail in his driveway. The rapper said he eventually confronted Combs during a meeting at a private club in Los Angeles, where Combs denied setting fire to his car.&nbsp; Other witnesses testifying on Thursday included George Kaplan, Combs&#39;s former executive assistant who quit after witnessing several violent incidents; Mylah Morales, a makeup artist who saw Ventura with facial injuries following an altercation with Combs at a Los Angeles hotel; Frederick Zemmour, a hotel manager in Beverly Hills who testified that a room would require deep cleaning after Combs&#39;s frequent stays; and Joshua Croft, a federal computer forensics agent who said he extracted data from three of Ventura&#39;s laptops. Combs has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, he could face life in prison. He is being held without bail in a Brooklyn jail. A jury of 12 New Yorkers and six alternates will decide his fate. The trial is expected to last at least eight weeks. Court will not be in session on Friday. Testimony will resume on Tuesday, May 27, since Monday is Memorial Day.

Joachim Trier's ""Sentimental Value"" premiered Wednesday night to the kind of rapturous response that Cannes is fabled for. The film, starring Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgard and Elle Fanning, marked Trier's follow-up to his lauded 2021 film ""The Worst Person in the World."" There's stagecraft that goes into Cannes' famous standing ovations, which makes the timed applause reports an often inaccurate reflection of how movies are received at the festival. But the thunderous ovation for ""Sentimental Value,"" at 15 minutes, was the most rousing of any film in Cannes by a large margin. ""What's that Bunuel quote? I make films for my friends?'"" Trier said, addressing the crowd. ""I feel you're all my friends tonight."" Trier's remark, while Fanning wiped away tears, was a poignant reference to ""Sentimental Value."" Reinsve, who starred in ""The Worst Person in the World,"" plays the actor daughter of a well-regarded filmmaker, Gustav (Skarsgard), who has put moviemaking before parenting most of their lives. When he writes a script for her, she immediately refuses. Gustav instead casts a young Hollywood star (Fanning). Much of the film is set around their old family home in Oslo, in which Gustav wants to make his film. As ""Sentimental Value"" proceeds, it gently unveils questions of family and home that have as much to do with artmaking as for fathers and daughters. After Charli xcx concluded her Coachella set with a screen declaring, among others, a ""Joachim Trier Summer,"" Fanning sported a shirt with that phrase Thursday in Cannes. But Trier may have coined a new slogan for shirts, himself: ""Tenderness is the new punk."" Trier explained to reporters how he and co-writer Eskil Vogt came from a punk background and were initially hesitant to make ""sobby movies."" ""But we realized through the films we've made that we've grown older and the world is a tough place, and maybe we need to be vulnerable and show characters that are vulnerable,"" said the Norwegian director. ""So we kind of came to the conclusion that tenderness is the new punk. For me, it is. It's what I need right now - I need to believe that we can see the other, that there is a sense of reconciliation, that polarization and machismo isn't the only way forward."" The debut of ""Sentimental Value"" immediately made Trier's film a contender, if not the clear favorite, for Cannes' top award, the Palme d'Or. Should ""Sentimental Value"" win on Saturday, when Cannes draws to a close, it would extend the indie distributor Neon's unprecedented streak of Palme d'Or wins. Neon has backed the last five Palme d'Or winners in Cannes, including last year's Oscar-winning ""Anora."" This year, it also acquired another film that could be in the mix, Brazilian filmmaker Kleber Mendonca Filho's ""The Secret Agent."" Should ""Sentimental Value"" win over the jury headed by Juliette Binoche, it would be the first Norwegian film to win the Palme d'Or. ___ For more coverage of the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/cannes-film-festival"

Liam Og O hAnnaidh, 27, has been charged by the Metropolitan Police after an incident on 21 November 2024 at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, London. Mr O hAnnaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 18 June. In a statement posted on social media, Kneecap said: ""We deny this 'offence' and will vehemently defend ourselves."" Social Media Mr O hAnnaidh has been charged in relation to an incident in Kentish Town ""This is political policing,"" it continued. ""This is a carnival of distraction. ""14,000 babies are about to die of starvation in Gaza, with food sent by the world sitting on the other side of a wall, and once again the British establishment is focused on us."" Officers from the Met's counter terrorism command were made aware on 22 April of an online video from the event. Belfast man Mr O hAnnaidh has been charged under the name Liam O'Hanna. An investigation was carried out, which led to the Crown Prosecution Service authorising the charge. Earlier this month, the Met said it would investigate online videos allegedly showing the group calling for the death of British MPs and shouting ""up Hamas, up Hezbollah"". Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon which has been involved in a series of violent conflicts. Kneecap say they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual. They say the video in question has been taken out of context. A number of gigs featuring the band have been called off since the videos emerged. They are currently scheduled to headline Wide Awake festival in Brockwell Park, south London, on Friday. Reuters The group go by the stage names of Mo Chara, DJ Provai and Moglai Bap Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise. The group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, Moglai Bap and DJ Provai.

The Chicago Fire Season 13 finale ended with Kidd revealing that she's pregnant! Elsewhere, Pascal (Dermot Mulroney) cleared his own name - with significant help from Severide - in the attempted murder of his wife's killer; Herrmann (David Eigenberg) announced he was stepping down to being a regular firefighter so Mouch (Christian Stolte) can be lieutenant of engine; and Violet (Hanako Greensmith) and Carver (Jake Lockett) said ""I love you"" ... just as he's planning to move to Denver. Below, showrunner Andrea Newman breaks down the finale and teases more change coming in Season 14. (She previously told us that the finale wouldn't be writing out Daniel Kyris Ritter and Jake Lockett's Carver and we'd have to tune in next season to see how their absences are explained.) Kidd's pregnant. Why did you take Stellaride on the journey you did with having a kid? Andrea Newman: I think that they both had, especially Kidd, some real issues and hesitations around it, and it didn't feel right to have her just jump into it from the start. Severide was ready before she was. In his mind, it was simpler for him for a bunch of reasons. It is more complicated for a female firefighter than a male firefighter. And in terms of just how they saw their own childhoods, it was complicated. But for Kidd especially so, and this season was really about her coming to understand all of that and understand the things that happened when her cousin came, and she got to really explore and talk about for the first time her aunt being so depressed after her pregnancy. And when she got to see how other people were mothering and go through that medical rollercoaster in Episode 20 of the baby, thinking they were going to adopt, and then at the end, the mom deciding to - her essentially empowering this mother to decide, ""I can do this,"" that gave her a preview of herself as a mother, I think, and her relationship with Natalie has done that for her. So I think she started to truly believe this is something not only that she can do, but that she really wants to do. And so that's where in my mind, she kind of left it to the fates. By the end of [Episode] 20, it's like, ""If the adoption thing happens, wonderful. If I get pregnant, wonderful, I can handle anything."" She kind of came to a place where she believed in herself enough to be ready for whatever parenthood was going to look like for her. So what can you tease about what this parenthood journey is going to look like now that Kidd is pregnant? Are you playing the usual between-seasons time jump so we'll pick up months into the pregnancy? Yeah, we always do that time jump. How much of a time jump, we don't know, but I think the way we are looking at it and who knows exactly what'll happen with this pregnancy journey for her, but what we want is that idea that parents who are first responders face, which is the stakes go so high. You think they're high now when you're married to the person in a firehouse, what if you're both trapped in a fire together and realizing you're going to leave your child orphan essentially, which is what happened to Kidd when she was young. So it's a big fear of hers. And now yeah, the stakes are just up. Everything gets dialed up when you deal with children on a call, you see the face of your own child. It's a way to really just amp everything up for these two and test this relationship in all new ways while keeping them in love and sexy and all the things we like about them together. But yeah, parenthood, that's going to shake it up for sure. Was the plan always to have Herrmann ultimately go back to being a regular firefighter instead of chief? Why go about it this way? From the very start, we knew that he had this incredible pressure on him because Boden had said in the finale last year, you're the one to take the throne essentially. And that coming from Boden, who Herrmann worships, is heavy pressure. And then on the other side, you have Mouch who had come back from his injury in the previous season, ""Call Me McHolland,"" like a totally rejuvenated firefighter on a war path. ""I'm not going to be the couch guy anymore."" So Herrmann's kind of caught between these two things. And the one thing he never asks himself as the snowball starts rolling down the hill is like, do I want this? And I think Pascal senses that and sensed that from the start, and so he's sort of testing him along the way, ""Try this, come to this event, try leading here."" During the crossover he said, ""You don't get to be boots on the ground, you got to stand here."" And in that moment Herrmann was like, ""I can't. I'll never forgive myself."" So Pascal's been watching and that was something we wanted to see, is Pascal turning the screws a little bit. And is he doing it for his own purposes or is he doing it to help Herrmann was always the question. And I think that's what leads all those roads to the finale and the decision that Herrmann makes. So with Herrmann no longer going for chief, is Pascal staying especially because he saw how much the firehouse rallied around him all season, with Monica's death and then in the finale? Yeah, I think the key moment for Pascal was in Episode 16 and the funeral for his wife, for Monica, when they all showed up and he said, ""Sorry, this funeral is family only,"" and Mouch said, ""That's why we're here, chief."" And to me, that felt like the moment that he understood he was part of this family, and he kind of took it in. He's so hard to read sometimes, Pascal, but that was one moment where you saw it really get him in the heart and the gut. So I feel like that from that moment moving forward, between that and between the deepening bond with Severide, 51 feels like his home. And if he blew it, it's going to be tragic, if he blew it because of his Achilles heel, Monica and him going after this guy, Severide is going to do everything he can for him, but Severide's questioning at the end of the day, did he do this, too? So yeah, he's got some things to deal with to be able to stay at 51, So he's definitely staying though now for Season 14? I think that - yeah, I mean, we'll see him in Season 14, for sure. You did seem to set up an exit for Carver, with Denver, but then he and Violet seem to be on the path to getting back together. So what can you say about their relationship now and how his plans might be changing? Yeah, it's such a journey for them to both be able to get to the place where they can say that to each other for different reasons, but it's been burning under the surface for both of them. So it was such a moment to have them be able to say that and come together, but it doesn't make all the problems go away either. As much as it is sort of soul-fulfilling for them and something they both needed to do, it doesn't make it go away, the fact that Carver feels like he can't heal, and he can't stay sober in the place where he has gone so far off the rails, that doesn't change just because Violet loves him. It's everything he's wanted in the world, but it doesn't change the reasons he was going to leave. So there are some big decisions to make for the two of them. And for Violet, she would never want to be the reason that he couldn't get well or if things went badly, she wouldn't want to be the reason why. So there's a lot of loaded, heartbreaking, and heart-fulfilling things between them, decisions to be made. We know that Daniel and Jake are leaving a series regulars. Is everyone else returning in the same capacity? Well, one of the reasons we did, and this was before we knew exactly how the ax would fall from above, but we wanted to play because it's very true to what's happening now in the world, this auditor coming in and saying, ""Look, CFD is cleaning house, and things are going to get shaken up,"" and there's nobody be safe in this shakeup. So next season is going to be about how the s**t really hits the fan once that mandate comes down and how things get shaken up and how our team can hold together as a family while all this craziness is happening around them. What else can you tease about next season? It's going to be very much about how the change affects everybody, not just from the top, but going down below, too. And one thing we learned when we brought in Pascal that was really fun is it's not just about getting to know this new character, it's that a new character brings out new sides to the characters we've had for a long time and you see different parts of them and get to know them better. So yeah, next season's going to be all about shakeups and how everybody reacts and new people and comings and goings. Is there anything that you had to scrap from this season? Any significant storylines that just didn't fit in for any reason? No, the stuff that was really important and emotional, we managed to keep. We found that we had so much driving story that a few - we love to do our comedy storylines as well, and a few of those ended up going by the wayside because stuff got so heavy and so locomotive towards the last few [episodes]. But there's definitely more to explore in terms of we haven't seen Kylie [Katelynn Shennett] a lot this season and we love Kylie, so how she fits into 51 next season is a good question. Where the relationships will go between all our main characters and what Herman will do now that he's taken a pay cut to make money - because we know he's not the best with money and finances, so he's going to try and find all sorts of new ways to make up the difference - and yeah, Mouch is going to feel bad about that and try and help and that sounds disastrous to me. Especially with all the kids that Herrmann has. I know, I know, exactly. That's what David said. He is like, ""Great, it's a sweet move, but what about my 800 kids at home? What am I going to do?"" There are quite a bit of shake-ups because Mouch is now going to be lieutenant on engine, there's the matter of 51 losing both Ritter and Carver, Kidd will be out at some point on maternity leave. Like you said, there could be other shakeups. What can you say about who's going to be where next season when it comes to all that? Yeah, I mean, that's really the question. And there's also the question of will they - and they have done this in the CFD - start having only two-man trucks? You can only have two people on engine, two people on squad, and then who goes where. And so yeah, it'll be tight, and we'll probably see some rotations of people coming in and covering and that can get messy, it's not as clean, and mistakes can get made when that happens out in the field because the communication's not as easy. So yeah, I think that'll be a bumpy and exciting road for the team. Chicago Fire, Season 14, Fall 2025, Wednesdays, 9/8c, NBC"

Epic Universe, the first major new theme park in the US in 20-plus years, is opening in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday. Fans are expected to camp out overnight ahead of the official opening day. Comcast's NBCUniversal says Epic is the ""most technologically advanced theme park"" ever. It cost an estimated $7.7 billion and took more than six years to build. Accordingly, Comcast is putting all its corporate muscle into the launch. Epic Universe ""showcases the incredible creativity, innovation, and operational excellence of our talented teams,"" Mark Woodbury, the chair of Universal Destinations & Experiences, told CNN. This moment is about more than a single company's awesome new roller coasters. It's about media giants meeting the growing demand for live experiences, or what some analysts call ""the experience economy."" ""People want to immerse themselves in the characters and franchises and content they love,"" said media analyst Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners. Disney, the reigning theme park king, recently announced a deal to develop a new park and resort in Abu Dhabi. It is also doubling its fleet of cruise ships around the world. Universal has more to come, as well. It is developing a theme park in the United Kingdom, slated to open in 2031. It also has smaller-scale projects in the works, like a horror experience in Las Vegas and a kids' resort in Frisco, Texas. ""Streaming wars"" to ""theme park wars"" Some of the same companies that have competed in the so-called ""streaming wars"" are also locked in ""theme park wars,"" Greenfield observed. Universal's two theme parks in Orlando have often been seen as the ""add-on"" for tourists who spend more time at Disney's four parks there. Disney has, of course, been paying close attention to its rival. In the past year, Disney has announced some major expansions to its Florida parks, giving fans new reasons to return in the years ahead. Epic Universe may start to change those calculations. Woodbury predicted that Epic ""will transform Universal Orlando Resort into a full week vacation destination that delivers mind-blowing experiences for global audiences."" Historically, Disney CFO Hugh Johnston told investors last year, ""Other non-Disney parks opening in Florida (have) been positive for Disney bookings."" When Greenfield was at Epic for a sneak preview of the park this spring, he was struck by how much space for further expansion Universal still has. He suggested this week's launch is ""step one to making Universal more of the destination versus the add-on."" An epic media frontier All four hours of NBC's ""Today"" show were live from Epic Universe on Wednesday morning to show off the park to viewers, and all of Comcast's top executives traveled to Orlando for Wednesday night's opening ceremony. Universal's parks promote NBC's intellectual property, of course - Epic has a ""How to Train Your Dragon"" world - but feature partner media brands, too, like The Wizarding World of Harry Potter from Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN's parent) and Super Nintendo World from Nintendo. In recent interviews, Universal executives have highlighted the new park's trackless ride systems, augmented reality features, and high-resolution projections. They say Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry is the company's most impressive attraction to date. Both Universal and Disney have leaned heavily on parks to generate profits during a turbulent period elsewhere across the media industry. As Comcast president Mike Cavanagh told analysts last month, the theme park business is unique because it ""is, within media, not at all exposed to the shift in time on screens from one venue to another."" After all, parks are the opposite of ""screen time"" - they're where the characters from screens appear to come to life."

During Wednesday's episode of The View, the Better Sister star was asked all about her penchant for enjoying a nice little snack break while in the middle of taking a shower. ""I don't do sandwiches. I don't do like, pastries,"" Biel explained. ""I have some boundaries! I'm not gonna eat a steak in there. But, you know what, I really like to drink my coffee in there. And then sometimes other things come in like, protein bars and stuff. It's so gross and weird! I'm sorry!"" Jessica Biel explains eating in the shower on 'The View'. ABC Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. While Sunny Hostin appeared to be on board with the idea, it was Goldberg's concerned glance toward the audience afterward that caught Biel's attention. ""I know, Whoopi, I'm sorry!"" Biel exclaimed, before jokingly adding, ""Now you don't want to be friends with me anymore."" Goldberg quickly shot down the suggestion that their friendship was at all in jeopardy over a little shower snack. ""No, no, I'm trying to think,"" the View moderator replied. ""That's a lot of multitasking, cause not only do you have to get away from the water, you have to get the food in your mouth, and then you've gotta get a towel, because some little kid's about to get in."" ""I'm just doing what I have to do to get out on time,"" Biel agreed. ""I got drop off at 8:30. I gotta get there!"" This isn't the first time Biel has spoken out about her love of a little shower snack. The 7th Heaven alum went viral in December 2023 when she posted a TikTok that featured her peeling and eating a blood orange during her quick rinse. She also dished a few quick tips for any future shower eaters in a follow-up TikTok that January. ""Here's my rules with shower eating: a ledge is really helpful, [somewhere] you can stick your cup, your yogurt container, your coffee, your espresso, whatever it is you're enjoying,"" Biel said at the time. ""But I like to take a bite or a sip and put it on the ledge, and then you do your thing. You wash your hair - keep the soap out - that's a big deal. It's pretty simple, guys. You can do this."" The only ""tricky thing,"" Biel confessed, is making sure that you keep your mouth closed while chewing. ""Chew, do not open the mouth [and] do not let the shower water in,"" she concluded. ""There you go, enjoy your shower-consuming."" The View airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET/10 a.m. PT on ABC. 0 of 30 secondsVolume 0%"

It blows my mind that our shows can still work."" Photo: Marcus Ingram/Getty Images It's time to party like we're extras in She's the Man. That's what the All-American Rejects want us to do, anyway, with their current tour giving the middle finger to big venues that charge a lawsuit-inducing amount of ticket fees. The band is embarking on what they call the House Party Tour, crowdsourcing stops directly from fans and playing in backyards, bowling alleys, and any other spaces that will have them. Front man Tyson Ritter, the voice behind aughts-era bangers such as ""Dirty Little Secret"" and ""Gives You Hell,"" isn't doing this for the money. Just look at the videos from the gigs and you'll understand why. ""We took $50,000 out of our own pockets, booked a bus, put the crew salary on, and started this wild sort of ride,"" he says. ""I recently read something about people financing festival tickets, the complete inaccessibility of the concert experience in 2025, and how it's juxtaposed against these wild and weird economic times. It blows my mind that our shows can still work."" While the All-American Rejects have remained a consistent touring band, the house-party pop-ups - which were coordinated at turbospeed at the start of May - coincide with the release of their first new song in over a decade, ""Sandbox."" The band will be opening for the Jonas Brothers at their stadium tour later this year, but Ritter insists they don't plan to move along from these shows anytime soon. ""This is going to be a feather we fly in our cap, and we're going to Yankee Doodle as far as we can go,"" he says. ""I felt like I was watching an echo of a yesterday that got me into doing this."" There's this frenetic energy and joy I see from these house-party videos that has become a rarer and rarer concertgoing experience. How did you all decide to give this tour a try? This has been reactive - since a show we played at the University of Southern California for a local college radio station at the start of the month. We wanted to do something that was as far away from the Los Angeles industry crowd as possible. We did a show the night before at this place called No Vacancy. It felt bad. It's the reason why artists often hate playing in Los Angeles, because it's such an industry-driven town - the guest lists on those things end up turning into a bunch of suits. So we played this pop-up at USC and tapped into a crowd that wanted to come to a free show. The night was so cinematic. Like a full-circle moment? The spirit of where we started was we were four kids that weren't cool and got to play at a high-school party. And that night at USC, we felt cool. Kind of like when kids would pass a tip jar around for us to be able to pay for gas to get there and back. So after that night, we all put our heads together to see what would be possible. My wife's getting ready to bring our second child into the world, and she's due in a week and a half. I told my manager, ""What if we do as many as we can in this week-and-a-half space? Let's do it the same way we did when we started out. Let's reach out to college radio stations and local businesses. Let's ask for a $5 donation at the door."" It was that simple. The other night we popped up in a bowling alley because the house party got rained out and we needed to be indoors. We called this local bowling alley in Minneapolis on Friday night. The owner was like, ""Nobody's here, yeah, you can do it."" Doing these shows, there's a kind of an unspoken risk of liability, especially when it started stirring up on social media. But he was like, ""This could be something great for my business."" At the end of the night he told us with tears in his eyes, ""You made our summer and you saved our bowling alley."" This is the energy that's gone into the whole thing. It's all positive. Whatever happened at USC was this pure, driven spirit of why we started. Have certain places you called suspected a catfishing situation? A lot of kids didn't go to the first couple of shows because they thought it was a cover band or thought it was just a spoof. Which I love. It endears me even more to this enterprise that we're starting here. These giant artists - I'm not going to say her name - aren't really selling out their shows anymore, and they pay for these arenas to make it look like they did. At one of these recent shows, you implored the crowd to ""support a rock-and-roll band that gives a shit about the common man."" Can you elaborate on this and explain where you think other bands are lacking in this regard? That's not a slight at any artist, and it's not a slight at any system, because we're all beholden to this complete monopoly of a world in America. Capitalism is ringing at its loudest right now. For me, it was that we could find an opening and an opportunity as four guys from Oklahoma who didn't come from much. I was raised in a trailer house. My first concert was sitting on my porch listening to a band that was playing at an outdoor pavilion because I couldn't afford tickets. I couldn't afford CDs. I found my music taste in the back seats of friends whose parents had money and could buy them. When we made up our band name, we almost came to regret it. Why did we call ourselves the rejects? But now it's such a badge of courage. When we came onto the scene, pop-punk was a thing, and then emo came around and we got lumped into those categories. But we're really just a pop-rock band from Oklahoma who came from a working-class backdrop. I think that's the reason why we're still together. So yeah, that speech the other night was me realizing all of those things in real time. It was like, This is the reason people are showing up. It's the have-nots and have-littles in the middle-of-nowhere America who keep the lights on for our country. They're often drive-through states for many of these big tours. Who's playing Ames, Iowa? Who's playing Green Bay, Wisconsin? Unless it's a big arena with the big old sponsor. You're seeing it now where these giant artists - I'm not going to say her name - aren't really selling out their shows anymore, and they pay for these arenas to make it look like they did. The first 25 percent of the arena gets sold from people buying $300 tickets, and they don't even know that the local promoter is getting hundreds of free tickets to fill the rest of the venue. I can't believe that's not something people don't put a class-action suit against, because it seems to be robbery. If I sold you a sandwich for $100 so I could give away my last sandwich to a guy on the street, then why did I pay $100 for that sandwich, man? Just give me a $5 sandwich and let's all eat together. So you were very strategic in the cities you chose for these shows. I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and there were a lot more venues for live music when I started playing in the city. I played at a record store that was literally just a metal building. Even touring in the van back in the day, almost every venue we played at, a local kid promoter got to promote it. That language for gestating and creating a space for local live music is dead now because every young artist thinks they have to have a TikTok video. Rock and roll was not born on TikTok. Music shouldn't have to be born in a social-media environment. It should be fostered in hometowns with local followings. Every kid after a show will come up and ask, ""How do you do it?"" They have no idea what to do next. I'll say, ""Play a coffee shop, play a record store, and play anywhere you can get not only your friends to support you, but people who might just want to come see a free live show."" Live music is a fellowship. We're so divisive right now. It's so fucking toxic out there. That's why I think rock and roll is going to come back in a big way. We're just trying to pull up any bootstraps to help the cause. Last year Liam Gallagher defended his choice in Oasis's opening act, Richard Ashcroft, after a sizable group of fans complained that they should have instead elevated a younger artist. Liam said, ""New bands have it easy today; it's the middle-aged bands I feel bad for."" As a band now firmly rooted in middle age, do you understand what he meant by this on a personal level? I get that. But it's hard to agree when he cites Richard Ashcroft from the Verve as an example of a guy who's having a hard time. He stood in the brightest sun you can possibly shine in as an artist. There are a lot of bands we came up with in our genre and scene that are great bands, who are in our age bracket, and they definitely don't get to open up for Oasis. Maybe he was referring to the relevance of it all - giving somebody a relevant spotlight. I know Cage the Elephant is going out with them for the American leg of the tour. That's a band who's older than us, and they're just now straddling a prime. That's what's exciting to me about being a little bit older and wiser. You know more about yourself to put it into art that's truthful. I really appreciate when artists know they can't find their truth and split up. That was honestly a big thing for me that ham-stringed our attempt to even try this again: Can we find music to evolve this band? I sat in front of a ""record"" button since I was 15 years old, and people kind of forget artists are allowed to experiment and grow. It's really nice to be putting out new music around this spectacle of a tour that we feel so proud to be showcasing. We still have something to say. Have you discussed with your peers the difficulty of maintaining success as you age? Great actors get so much better with age. It's not because they're afraid anymore. They're actually at ease. I feel like we had 13 years off from our last real offering. There was a lot of time to develop. When we were young and full of piss and vinegar, it was all about anticipation and expectation. The giant major-label system pressing down from the ivory tower made us feel like if we didn't perform, then it was all going to be over. Right now, we're self-funded in a world that's forcibly injecting every popular song into the masses. We're able to control our narrative as a band. That's what I'm trying to inspire younger artists to do right now. Quit trying to shoot for a viral TikTok video, which has nothing to do with music. What's the narrative you're now trying to build? We wanted to find a culture for this band that was based on the love of the music. Finding it through these shows has not only reinvigorated our love for this whole attempt; it makes me so excited about how it'll be received. That crowd showed up, and it felt like this wild aughts rom-com culture in front of us. We're fired up on new music more than we've ever been, because now there's actually some resonance, soul, and an energy that's very feral from being kept in a burlap sack for over a decade. The cat's out of the bag, baby. And the cat's name is Pandora."

Some of these were plucked straight from the Last of Us Part II video game, others are brand new for the series. The most important one, however, was Joel and Ellie's final conversation on his back porch. If you've never played the games (and remember, the TV show is spreading the story of the second game across three seasons, of which we've just finished the first third), you might not know this scene was originally withheld from players until the very end of the game, meaning viewers are seeing it drastically earlier.So why did the show make such a huge change? According to series director Neil Druckmann, the show's crew thought it ""wouldn't work"" to deny viewers that moment for years. To which I say: That's coward shit. Druckmann talked about the scene alongside showrunner Craig Mazin and Part II narrative lead Halley Gross on the latest episode of the Last of Us podcast. The weekly show gives fans a behind-the-scenes look at the making of each episode, and this week Druckmann explains how nervous he was about recreating the scene for the show. Because, he says, it's ""the most important scene in the entire story."" Yeah, it's the Rosetta Stone through which we interpret everything that happens in The Last of Us Part II, so the show needed to get it right. (I'd argue they butchered it by making Pedro Pascal clarify and explain everything his character is feeling in an exhaustive fashion, but I digress.) This scene is kept until the very end of The Last of Us Part II because it's meant to recontextualize everything that's come before. The player is walled off from the full scope of Ellie's motivations as she undergoes a violent transformation. Gradually finding out through flashbacks that her and Joel's relationship had deteriorated over the years to the point of her going no-contact with him is a core part of the game's narrative structure-but none of it comfortably explained her destructive spiral. It was previously left unclear for the player for most of the story. So, latterly finding out she carried out her vendetta because she had lost an opportunity to reconcile with Joel, just as she was opening up to the idea, is a heartbreaking reveal. We finally learn what tipped her over the edge at the very end. Now, the show has revealed this before the story is even halfway over. Some (me) might argue this fundamentally undermines the narrative tension of the story, so why move it? Here's what Druckmann has to say with more context: ""That porch scene, I was so nervous about that because again, that scene is to me the most important scene in the entire story,"" he said. ""Which is why, in the game, it's at the very end. One of the choices that we made to bring it up, and the reason we brought it up, is because we were worried it wouldn't work if you had to wait years to get this pay-off. And it felt here, as we're on this journey with Ellie, it felt appropriate to do it in this moment in time."" It is a microcosm of the biggest issue with the season, for me. The constant expositional dumps, the lack of subtext in the writing, and the shifting around every reveal to ensure all viewers are quickly on the same page probably makes some feel more comfortable. But I contend it is fundamentally cutting the story off at the knees, seemingly because they didn't want to force viewers into that same disconnect the games thrive in. If game players could barely stand that dissonance for 20-plus hours of a video game, they worry, how could viewers bear it for years between seasons? I'd argue that years of dissonance should have been the consequence of adapting the game into multiple seasons, rather than treating the original material's structure-which was core to how the story was written-as an inconvenience needing to be written around. But as I've said in my recaps, this show seems hellbent on removing every divisive thorn from the source material, and the result is a far less bold and thought-provoking take on Ellie and Abby's revenge tours. If HBO is extending this story into three seasons, we're not even halfway through this adaptation, and we already know pretty much every twist and turn because it was thought the original structure ""wouldn't work."" The Last of Us Part II was divisive, but it was unflinching. The show just continues to pull its punches and offer nothing in their place. This isn't just a simple critique of HBO not doing things exactly the way they were in the game; it's that it seems these decisions have been made without considering how it could unravel a story that was very deliberate in how it was told. Anyway, we've got one episode left until the season's over, and fans are already bracing themselves for what's to come after seeing the finale's preview."
'Pee-wee as Himself' gives unprecedented access to an eccentric comedy legend - NPR,entertainment,"Also on TV this week, a new season of Nine Perfect Strangers premieres on Hulu, and new episodes of Couples Therapy debut on Paramount+ with Showtime.",Eric Deggans,NPR,2025-05-21T14:30:28+00:00,"'Pee-wee as Himself' gives unprecedented access to an eccentric comedy legend toggle caption Getty/HBO Moments into the illuminating, two-part HBO documentary Pee-wee as Himself, what emerges pretty quickly is a struggle for control.

Paul Reubens, the performer who invented the Pee-wee Herman character and turned him into a worldwide pop culture icon, faces the camera in the documentary's opening moments, jousting with director Matt Wolf over the question of whether Reubens should direct it all himself. ""Many people - alright, everyone but me - feel that you don't, as the subject of a documentary ... you don't have perspective really on yourself,"" Reubens says, winking impishly at the lens, like a graying version of Pee-wee. ""I will argue that. And you and I are going to be arguing that for a long, long time. Until this documentary is finished. You mark my words."" Sponsor Message Unfortunately, Reubens never got a chance to see the finished project, which debuts Friday on HBO and Max. After taping 40 hours of interviews, he unexpectedly cut off contact with Wolf and the production after a year. As the documentary notes, Reubens died July 30, 2023 - he had been fighting cancer for years, but kept his diagnosis private from almost everyone. The day before he died, however, he did record audio featured in the film. ""More than anything, the reason I wanted to make a documentary was to let people see who I really am and how painful and difficult it was to be labeled something I wasn't ... a pedophile,"" Reubens says in a raspy voice. ""I knew it was going to change everything moving forward ..."" Reubens had already turned over many hours of footage and thousands of photographs taken over his life and career, giving Wolf and his production team unprecedented access to chart the rise and fall of an eccentric, brilliant comedy legend. Reubens' regular attempts to push or charm the director into giving him more control - including a video call where he suggests that he should get to interview the documentary's other subjects himself - is a prickly spice that helps move viewers through a sprawling, complex tale. Sponsor Message And what a story, including Reubens' early days in The Groundlings comedy troupe developing the character of Pee-wee Herman - a grown-up kid with a funny voice and habit of wearing high-water pants with a bow tie around his neck. Eventually, the character emerges as a worldwide phenomenon, leading three movies and a kids show on CBS. Throughout, Wolf's documentary provides a telling look at the relentless perfectionism and drive required to fulfill Reubens' ambitions, filled out by interviews with friends and collaborators like Laurence Fishburne and Debi Mazar. toggle caption HBO/Pee-wee Herman Productions, Inc. Words from Reubens' interviews provide most of the narration, revealing that he was often torn about his decision to rarely appear in public as himself, so that the world only knew him as his alter ego, Pee-wee. That strategy helped him keep a personal anonymity - for example, it hid that he was gay and, in his words, ""a huge weed head"" - while building up the character's popularity. But it also meant few people knew how much his vision shaped the films and TV shows featuring the character. (He admits being jealous of the way Tim Burton, who directed the first film Pee-wee's Big Adventure in 1985, got so much credit for the movie's success.) That anonymity also hurt him in 1991, when he was arrested at an adult movie theater in Sarasota, Fla., by police, who charged him with indecent exposure. Years later, in 2002, he was charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography in Los Angeles for images police said they found in his extensive collection of kitsch memorabilia and vintage pornography. He eventually entered a plea of no contest to the 1991 charges and pleaded guilty to a lesser obscenity charge in 2004. In Pee-wee as Himself, Reubens and his representatives deny that he exposed himself in 1991 or that the photos police found in 2002 depicted children. Sponsor Message The documentary outlines the backlash Reubens endured as a result of the arrests, and the words he recorded on his last day show how much those scandals still weighed on him, decades later. And yet, even as Reubens uses the documentary to tell his side, Wolf balances the story with interviews featuring former employees noting that his controlling ways and tendency toward conflict with collaborators could also cause problems. In the end, Pee-wee as Himself offers a touching portrait of an artist who rarely revealed himself publicly - in the process, explaining why sharing his personal story was so difficult in the first place. What else is on TV this week? Nine Perfect Strangers Season 2 debuts Wednesday on Hulu YouTube There are a lot of TV shows out there these days looking to satirize clueless wealthy (mostly) white people and their bizarre blind spots. (For instance, Netflix's Sirens and the HBO film Mountainhead both tackle that subject this week and next). But there are few projects that marry absurdity, satire, suspense and drama quite like Nine Perfect Strangers, which centers a group of privileged folks assembled at a wellness retreat helmed by a demanding, risk-taking guru played by Nicole Kidman. In the show's second season, Kidman's strangely-accented character Masha isolates her group at a resort in the snowy Austrian Alps, where they are secretly and not-so-secretly dosed with hallucinogens, following a wellness regimen that seems to include her own very personal agendas. Backed by an ensemble including Mark Strong, Christine Baranski and Murray Bartlett, it's an interesting ride that balances the dramatic and bizarre in compelling ways. Couples Therapy The second part of Season 4 debuts Friday on Paramount+ with Showtime YouTube I don't like much so-called ""reality TV"" - mostly because I don't think many shows are honest enough with viewers or participants. But this series, featuring four couples counseled by psychologist and psychoanalyst Dr. Orna Guralnik, does a wonderful job of exploring how people can fall into relationship-busting patterns of behavior and the tremendous effort required to change. As a plus, Dr. Guralnik is shown talking over their cases with other therapists, providing a look at how she is developing strategies for helping her clients. And though the subjects are obviously aware of the presence of cameras, the show is open about showing when they may be affected by the production and when they are engrossed in telling their own stories. One word of warning: If you've been through a divorce, as I have, watching bickering couples in classic conflict cycles may be a little triggering. Still worth it."

The event, which began in 1982 and takes place Saturday and Sunday, is undergoing a number of changes in 2025. Ahead of the festival, here's everything you need to know. This feels early for Artscape. Isn't it usually in July? Yes. For years, Artscape took place in July and always seemed to fall on the hottest weekend of the year (to the annoyance of many attendees). More recently, the city tried to find the sweet spot in the calendar. They tried September in 2023 but canceled a full day of events due to Tropical Storm Ophelia. Last year's Artscape, held the first weekend in August, also saw cancellations - including headliner Chaka Khan's performance - because of dangerously hot and stormy weather. The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one. The hope in 2025 is that earlier is better. While many families make out-of-town plans for Memorial Day weekend, Baltimore is banking on locals and visitors to base their holiday plans around Artscape. The festival hours are 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. both days, with ""After Dark"" programming - including Saturday's after-party at Ikonic Live (316 Guilford Ave.) - from 9 p.m. to midnight. How's the weather looking anyway? We might just be in luck. Saturday's forecast is a high of 72 degrees and mostly sunny, while Sunday will be a tick warmer with a high of 76 degrees and mostly sunny, per the National Weather Service. Please, please let this be the year Artscape's bad weather curse is broken. I've heard some chatter about Artscape's relocation. What's going on? A new date for the festival hasn't been the only change to get Baltimoreans talking. For decades, Artscape has been synonymous with Mount Vernon and the nearby neighborhoods within the Station North Arts District - areas that have benefited from the festival's foot traffic. Mayor Brandon Scott and organizers say it's time for downtown to reap some rewards. As part of his Downtown RISE initiative, Artscape's new footprint includes areas closer to the Inner Harbor, such as the underpass beneath the Jones Falls Expressway, the Baltimore War Memorial, The Peale museum and more. The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one. A map of Artscape, which is relocating from Station North and Mount Vernon to downtown in May 2025. (Courtesy of Artscape) While some are embracing the changes, not everyone is thrilled about Artscape's move. Who's providing the jams? Every year, music fans anticipate Artscape's performers. Saturday's artists include headliner Fantasia, Little Brother, Tweet and LeToya Luckett, while Sunday features Robin Thicke, Tanner Adell and Mike Thomas, among others. Check out the full lineup. What else is new this year? The Scout Art Fair aims to make buying art affordable and accessible, with works priced between $150 and $5,000. Curated by acclaimed artist Derrick Adams and Baltimore Beat arts and culture editor Teri Henderson, the fair will feature 40 solo artist booths and six gallery booths, with a portion of the sales proceeds set to benefit programs for the Baltimore Office of Promotion & the Arts. Meanwhile, the Oasis Mural Project is injecting art and color under the Jones Falls Expressway, where this year's artisan market will be held. In recent weeks, many artists - including Ernest Shaw, Gaia, Liz Miller and LaToya Peoples - have been painting bright murals on more than 40 concrete columns. For more programming information, head to Artscape's website. The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one. I'm showing up hungry. What's the food situation? Baltimore's diverse culinary scene will be on full display this weekend, whether you're in the mood for Thai, vegan, Jamaican, empanadas, juices, mochichi (Hawaiian-style shaved ice) or Ekiben's Asian fusion dishes. And that's just a sampling. Speaking of food: Will the farmers' market still take place? The city's popular farmers' market held under the JFX is taking this Sunday off for Artscape but will resume operations next weekend. This all sounds fun but I like options. What else is going on this weekend? There's never a dull weekend in Charm City. Aside from Artscape, there's the sci-fi/fantasy convention Balticon, the craft beer bonanza Brew at the Zoo, the SOWEBO Arts and Music Festival, just to name a few other events. And if extremely loud metal is more your thing, pull out your favorite studded leather outfit and head to the 20th Maryland Deathfest, which is also being held downtown."

Emma Chamberlain, a Gemini. Photo-Illustration: by The Cut; Photos: Getty Images With the moon and Mars in watery Pisces and fiery Leo, respectively, it could be difficult to sort through your feelings today. Your emotions are bouncing all over the place, with no apparent rhyme or reason, and it might be easy to get carried away in the heat of the moment. Do your best to slow down and think before you take action - while your initial impulses might steer you in the wrong direction, a bit of thoughtful reflection can get you back on track. Aries Daily Horoscope It can feel as though hard work doesn't ""count"" unless others notice it and your ideas don't matter until you share them. It's not that gaining others' approval is your top priority, only that you know that there's little value in going unrecognized. Today, though, remember that solitude can be an important part of the process; you don't have to share every step of your journey with everyone around you. If you give yourself space to reflect privately now, you'll have more clarity and confidence later on. Taurus Daily Horoscope The more judgmental you are toward yourself, the harder it is to show others any compassion. You hold everyone, yourself included, to impossible standards, and even though part of you knows you're being unrealistic, you still get frustrated when they fall short. Today, do your best to be a bit kinder to yourself. Everybody has imperfections, and if you can accept yours, it'll become easier to be understanding when your friends make mistakes, too. Gemini Daily Horoscope You understand that most things can't be rushed - at least not if you want good results. Relationships develop at their own speed, and creative projects will take as long as they take; while hard work might speed up the timeline a little bit, there's only so much you can do. Today, though, it might be easy to forget all this and to imagine that if you just picked up your pace, you could have what you want much sooner. Do your best to resist this impulse - right now, rushing is likely to lead to mistakes that'll slow you down in the end. Cancer Daily Horoscope When you know exactly what you want, it's easy to act with intention and resolve. But when your own desires are unclear to you, it's practically impossible to move with a sense of purpose. And while a bit of aimless wandering can sometimes be relaxing, even creatively generative, today it's more likely to be frustrating and unfulfilling. It might be tempting to focus on coming up with a more solid plan for your life, but your energy will be better spent thinking about what you actually want. Once you figure that out, your next steps will become clearer. Leo Daily Horoscope You probably aren't the sort of person to waver when it comes to important decisions; you tend to feel things intensely and make up your mind quickly. Occasionally, though, there are times when your emotions are muddled and you can't quite tell how you feel. It's easy to wonder whether there's something wrong with you or whether there is clarifying information that you're just not seeing - but in reality, the truth is that some situations are just complicated. If you need some extra time to figure out what you want, that's normal. Virgo Daily Horoscope Others might try to meddle in your business today, maybe out of a well-intentioned desire to help or maybe out of ulterior motives of their own. They might try to convince you that they understand your needs better than you do or that you don't have the necessary expertise - but none of this is true. Right now, the most important thing you can do is trust yourself. While you don't know everything, you do know your own life better than anyone else does; listen to others' advice, but don't feel pressured to act on it if it doesn't feel right. Libra Daily Horoscope You work hard to make smart choices and to act in the ways that will benefit you and the people around you - so it can be hard to be reminded that you're not, in fact, a perfectly rational being. Your emotions can be illogical and contradictory, and you sometimes act on them in surprising and unproductive ways. Today, in particular, it might be hard to do the things that you know you ""should"" - but this is only human, so accept it as such. Scorpio Daily Horoscope You're probably feeling ready to make some discernible progress in your life - maybe for your own sense of satisfaction or maybe because you're tired of feeling as if you're lagging behind your friends. Either way, though, if you fixate on achievements and milestones today, you might end up losing sight of what you actually care about. It's not easy to relax and enjoy the process while obsessing over results, but try. You'll be more likely to see payoff in the long run if you let curiosity, not ambition, guide you now. Sagittarius Daily Horoscope Lately, you're longing for adventure - the trouble is that you want only the fun parts, not the stressors. Every time you get the opportunity to do something exciting, part of you wants to jump at it, but another part of you can only think of all the potential dangers. You might be tempted to seek out a third option that miraculously encompasses both - but today, there's probably no way to have it both ways, so think about what's most important to you. Capricorn Daily Horoscope You might get the sense that your friends are keeping things from you today, hiding their true opinions or deeper feelings. It's a lonely feeling, and it makes you worry that they don't trust you, that they see you as someone they can't be vulnerable with. But try not to take it personally, because chances are, if your friends are holding anything back, it has nothing to do with you; it's more likely they just need a little privacy while they work through their own ideas. Aquarius Daily Horoscope You know that you can't tell other people how to live their lives, but part of you wishes you could. Lately, everyone around you seems to be behaving in ways that are counterproductive or unethical or just annoying, and you want to step in and force them all to do better. But today, remember that your perspective is limited, and there are probably things going on in your friends' lives that you don't see. You can offer advice when others ask, but the only life you're truly in charge of is your own. Pisces Daily Horoscope Sometimes it feels as though the people around you are actively trying to frustrate you; they seem to insist on acting in ways specifically designed to push your buttons. But today, consider the possibility that they just don't actually know what you need from them. No matter how clearly you think you've expressed your needs, it's possible that they still haven't understood. Instead of assuming that people are intentionally causing problems, it could be worth trying one more time to have a conversation about it.

Supreme Court sidesteps major ruling on religious public charter schools - NBC News,general,Oklahoma will not be able to launch the nation's first ever religious public charter school after the Supreme Court on Thursday deadlocked 4-4 in a major case on the separation of church and state.,Lawrence Hurley,NBC News,2025-05-22T14:11:00+00:00,WASHINGTON - Oklahoma will not be able to launch the nation's first religious public charter school after the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 Thursday in a major case on the separation of church and state.

The decision by the evenly divided court means a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that said the proposal to launch St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School violates both the federal Constitution and state law remains in place. St. Isidore would have operated online statewide with a remit to promote the Catholic faith. Follow live politics coverage here Paul Coakley, the archbishop of Oklahoma City, and David Konderla, the bishop of Tulsa, said in a joint statement that they are ""exploring other options"" to provide an online education statewide. ""Families across the state of Oklahoma deserve the educational opportunities presented by St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School,"" they added. As there was no majority, the court did not issue a detailed written decision, and the case sets no nationwide precedent on the contentious legal question of whether religious schools must be able to participate in taxpayer-funded state charter school programs. A key factor in the outcome was that conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who would have been the deciding vote, did not participate in the case. She did not explain why, but it is most likely because of her ties with Notre Dame Law School. The law school's Religious Liberty Clinic represents the school. The one-page decision did not say how each justice voted. During oral arguments last month, most of the court's conservatives indicated support for the school while liberals expressed concern. At least one conservative is likely to have sided with the liberals, most likely Chief Justice John Roberts. The court, with Barrett on board, is likely to be asked to weigh in on the issue in future cases, though none are likely to reach the justices imminently. The Oklahoma case was a victory for state Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who challenged a state board's approval of the school and found himself on the opposite side of fellow Republicans in the state who backed the idea. Drummond, who is running for governor, said in a statement that the decision was a ""resounding victory for religious liberty"" that would ensure that taxpayer money would not go toward ""radical Islamic schools,"" as well as the Catholic school at issue in the case. Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which challenged the school's approval in a separate case, also welcomed Thursday's decision. ""We will continue our efforts to protect inclusive public education. We call on this nation to recommit to church-state separation before this safeguard of democracy and freedom is further attacked,"" she said in a statement. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt described the decision on X as a ""non-decision"" that did not resolve the issue. ""This is far from a settled issue,"" wrote Stitt, a Republican. ""We are going to keep fighting for parents' rights to instill their values in their children and against religious discrimination."" The case highlights tensions within the Constitution's First Amendment; one provision, the Establishment Clause, prohibits state endorsement of religion or preference for one religion over another, while another, the Free Exercise Clause, bars religious discrimination. The Oklahoma Supreme Court had cited the state's interest in steering clear of Establishment Clause violations as a reason not to allow the proposal, submitted by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa, to move forward. The state approved the proposal for St. Isidore in June 2023 despite concerns about its religious nature, prompting Drummond to sue. The U.S. Supreme Court, when Barrett is participating, has a 6-3 conservative majority that often backs religious rights. In recent years, it has repeatedly strengthened the Free Exercise Clause in cases brought by conservative religious liberty activists, sometimes at the expense of the Establishment Clause. Some conservatives have long complained that the common understanding that the Establishment Clause requires strict separation of church and state is incorrect. Lawyers representing the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board sought to portray the dispute as similar to a series of recent rulings in which the court said that under the Free Exercise Clause, states cannot bar religious groups from government programs that are open to everyone else. During the oral argument, Roberts pushed back, indicating that he saw the schools case as different from the previous decisions. Those cases, he said, ""involved fairly discrete state involvement"" compared with Oklahoma's charter school program. ""This does strike me as a much more comprehensive involvement,"" he added. The push for religious public charter schools dovetails with the school choice movement, which supports parents using taxpayer funds to send their children to private school. Public school advocates see both efforts as broad assaults on traditional public schools. A key question left unresolved in the Oklahoma case is whether charter schools are indistinguishable from public schools, which factors in to whether they have religious rights and can bring free exercise claims in the first place. Currently, all 47 states that allow charter schools consider them to be public schools and bar religious schools from participating in their programs. As was raised during oral arguments, there is also a federal program with funds for charter schools that prevents money from going to sectarian schools. With no other states close to approving religious charter schools, said Stephanie Barclay, an expert on religious liberty at Georgetown Law School, there are no cases pending that raise the precise issue as the Oklahoma dispute. But she highlighted a case from Maine that raises questions about the extent to which religious schools can be barred from receiving government funding through tuition assistance, which the Supreme Court may have a chance to hear relatively soon if it wishes to further strengthen the Free Exercise Clause. ""That's a more likely next step the court could take,"" she said."

With the home engulfed in flames and jet fuel rolling down the streets, half a dozen vehicles ignited while residents in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing were shaken awake just before 4 a.m. by the thunderous crash and subsequent explosions. Out their windows, they saw a wall of fire. ""I can't quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,"" San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said.

Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group, and two employees were among those killed, the music agency said in a statement. Sound Talent Group has represented artists including American pop band Hanson, American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and the Canadian rock group Sum 41.

Daniel Williams, former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada, posted on his Instagram on Wednesday afternoon that he was boarding the plane with Shapiro. The band posted a tribute to Williams on their Instagram page. ""No words. We owe you everything. Love you forever,"" the band wrote.

Neighborhood hit hard The home that was struck was destroyed, with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed, and about 10 others were damaged in Murphy Canyon, the largest neighborhood of Navy-owned housing in the country, officials said. Ben McCarty and his wife, who live in the home that was hit, said they felt heat all around them. ""My wife was screaming, and she's like, There's a fire,'"" McCarty, who has served in the Navy for 13 years, told local ABC affiliate KGTV. When he walked toward the front of the house, he saw that the roof had fallen off and flames blocked their exit. They grabbed their children and dogs and ran to the back, where their neighbors helped them climb over the fence to escape. The plane also hit both of the couple's vehicles, which burned. ""It put my truck into our living room,"" McCarty said. Other vehicles along the block were melted and scorched into burned shells. One stubborn car fire sent smoke billowing up for hours. Ariya Waterworth said she woke up to a ""whooshing sound"" and then saw a giant fireball outside. She screamed for help as firefighters arrived and helped her get out with her two children and their family dog. One of the family's cars was ""completely disintegrated,"" and the other had extensive damage. Her yard was littered with plane parts, broken glass and debris. ""I definitely do feel blessed, because we've been spared,"" she said. At least 100 residents were evacuated. Hours after the crash, jet fuel rolled down Salmon Street. The smell of fumes lingered throughout the day, and officials said it was unclear when it would be safe for people to return.

Based on the flight path, it was bound for Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when it struck power lines about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of the airfield, Simpson said. Audio recorded by www.liveATC.net includes a brief transmission from the pilot saying he was on final approach to the airport and was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) out at 3:45 a.m. NTSB investigators planned to spend Thursday and Friday at the scene gathering evidence, Simpson said. He welcomed video or other details from any witnesses. The plane was attempting t o land in foggy weather At that hour and in foggy weather, the plane was likely operating on an instrument flight rules plan, which is typically used during reduced visibility, said Barry Newman, a board-certified aviation attorney. However, for that airport, once an aircraft reaches 673 feet (205 meters), the pilot also has to rely on sight. ""If a pilot descends to that level and he can't see the runway, he has to call for a missed approach or divert to another airport,"" Newman said. In October 2021 a twin-engine plane plowed into a San Diego suburb, killing the pilot and a UPS delivery driver on the ground and burning homes. It was preparing to land at the airport. And in December 2008, a Marine Corps fighter jet slammed into a house in San Diego's University City neighborhood, causing an explosion that killed four people inside. The Marine Corps blamed the crash on mechanical failure and human error.

The aid, which included flour, baby food and medical equipment, was picked up from the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday night and taken to warehouses for distribution. Several bakeries began producing bread with the flour on Thursday. The UN said the delays were due to a lack of security along the single access route approved by Israel's military. Israeli authorities said they allowed an additional 100 lorry loads through Kerem Shalom on Wednesday. However, the UN said it was ""nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza"". About 500 lorries entered the territory on average every day before the war, the UN has said. Humanitarian organisations have warned of acute levels of hunger among the 2.1 million population, amid significant shortages of basic foods and skyrocketing prices. Palestinian Authority Health Minister Majed Abu Ramadan, who is based in the occupied West Bank, told reporters on Thursday that 29 children and elderly people had died from ""starvation-related"" causes in the last couple of days, according to Reuters news agency. Half a million people face starvation in the coming months, an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has said. A UN World Food Programme (WFP) official said the UN and its partners had over 140,000 tonnes of food - about 6,000 lorry loads and enough to feed the entire population for two months - in position at aid corridors and ready to be brought into Gaza at scale. Israel stopped all deliveries of aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the armed group to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel has insisted that there has been no shortage of aid and has accused Hamas of stealing supplies to give to its fighters or sell to raise money - an allegation the group denied. The UN also denied that aid had been diverted. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated the claim on Thursday, saying in a statement: ""I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Starmer: When mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice."" Netanyahu said the leaders of France, Canada and the UK had ""bought into Hamas's propaganda that says Israel is starving Palestinian children"". He reiterated that Israel and the US would set up their own aid delivery to be done through American companies in Gaza, bypassing the UN and other aid suppliers. Netanyahu had previously said he was allowing in a limited amount of food so that the Israeli military could continue its newly expanded ground offensive and take full control of the Palestinian territory. He said on Thursday that construction of the first distribution zones in the scheme would be completed ""in the coming days"". The UN and other agencies have said they will not co-operate with US-Israeli plan, saying it contradicts fundamental humanitarian principles and appears to ""weaponise aid"". The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had brought in one lorry load of medical supplies for the Red Cross field hospital in the southern city of Rafah, but that more was needed. ""A trickle of trucks is woefully inadequate. Only the rapid, unimpeded, and sustained flow of aid can begin to address the full scope of needs on the ground,"" it said. Mandy Blackman, the nurse in charge of running the charity UK-Med's field hospital in the southern al-Mawasi area, described the situation in Gaza as ""heart-breaking"", with food in perilously short supply. She told the BBC that patients arriving at the hospital were ""visibly thinner"" than during her previous two stints there, and that staff were only able to offer them one meal a day, consisting of rice with some pulses. ""People are having to relocate constantly and are not able to feed their children. No-one knows what's going to happen the next day. There's constant suffering and constant anxiety,"" she said. Reuters Palestinian workers were pictured unloading sacks of flour at a bakery in the southern city of Khan Younis overnight Before the aid entered Gaza, senior WFP official Antoine Renard had told the BBC that the problems with collecting it arose because the Israeli military wanted lorries to move along a route which aid agencies considered to be dangerous. The route, he said, could leave them at risk of attack by desperately hungry civilians and armed criminal gangs. ""At market prices in Gaza right now, each truck full of flour is worth around $400,000 (298,000),"" Mr Renard explained. He added that the solution would be ""hundreds of trucks daily"" travelling along a safe route to warehouses, noting ""the less we provide, the greater the risk and more anxiety created"" among the population. Mr Renard said aid agencies on the Gaza side did not employ armed guards to accompany their cargoes because it was considered too dangerous, so a lengthy ceasefire and an extension of the current five-day window for the transfer of food was urgently needed. According to Mr Renard, bringing in at least 100 aid lorries daily would only meet the ""very minimum"" of the population's food needs. Reuters The UN said the aid was ""nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza"""

Steichen previously was Philly's offensive coordinator, and Gannon was the defensive coordinator. Both left after the 2022 season. In March, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni addressed (with a grin) the positions he expected Steichen, Gannon, and Saints coach Kellen Moore (the Eagles' offensive coordinator in 2024) to take. ""Gannon, Steichen, and Moore better vote for it,"" Sirianni said. ""They are in the position right now because of that play. So all three, I better have those three votes right there and the Eagles' vote. I at least know we have four."" Moore and the Saints opposed the proposal. Obviously, Steichen and Gannon didn't have the final say regarding their teams' positions. It'll be for them to explain to Sirianni why they weren't able to make a difference. By next year, when the league potentially takes another run at killing the play, the Eagles may have placed one or two more coordinators in head-coaching jobs - if the Eagles fly again to a Super Bowl, and if offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio get opportunities."

In a statement to Parliament Thursday following the release of an independent sentencing review, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said so-called chemical castration would be used in 20 prisons in two regions. ""And I am exploring whether mandating the approach is possible,"" she said. ""Of course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control."" Though the review highlighted the treatment would not be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending. It's been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders. The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former justice secretary, David Gauke. As well as looking at ways to cut reoffending, Gauke recommended reforms to overhaul the prisons system, which is running at near-capacity. One of the first things Mahmood did as justice minister after Labour returned to power after 14 years last July was sanction an early-release program for prisoners to free up space. She says she doesn't want to do that again and set up the review and appointed a Conservative predecessor to oversee it. The review recommended that criminals could be released from prison earlier than currently, while judges could be given more flexibility to impose punishments such as driving bans. It also recommended that sentences of less than 12 months would also be scrapped, apart from exceptional circumstances such as domestic abuse cases. It also called for the immediate deportation for foreign nationals handed a three-year sentence or less. The review called for higher investment in the probation service to allow officers to spend more time with offenders for their rehabilitation and extra funding for the tens of thousands more offenders being electronically tagged in the community. Mahmood responded by giving a 700 million-pound ($930 million) a year for probation within years. ""If the government doesn't put the resources into probation that is necessary, then the risk here is that we won't make progress on rehabilitation that we need, and there will be a public backlash against it,"" Gauke said. The prison population in England and Wales has doubled over the past 30 years or so to nearly 90,000. That's despite a fall in crime rates and is driven in part by the fact that longer sentences are being handed out amid pressure to be tough on crime. Robert Jenrick, the justice spokesman for the Conservatives, was clear in his opposition to the proposals and warned that scrapping short sentences would be effectively ""decriminalizing"" offenses like burglary, theft and assault. And tags, he said, are as useful as ""smoke alarms putting out bonfires"" when it comes to stopping reoffending. Alongside accepting any changes, the government has said it will embark on a big prison building program, partly to replace some that have been used since Victorian times in the late 19th century."

While missing some of the necessary communication that make the best strategy games tick, it's still a blast to raise some shell as New York's bodacious band of brothers. Trim and concise, Tactical Takedown doesn't waste time on an ooze-spilling origin story to get its story moving. You'll know just about everything you need to after the first five minutes, though I'm sure you can guess: The Foot Clan, led by Shredder's daughter Karai, is up to no good as always. This time, they've teamed up with mad scientist and fellow stalwart TMNT villain Baxter Stockman as they unleash a new plot to take over New York. Dialogue is relegated to only a minute or two of text boxes before and after each level, but Tactical Takedown still manages to make the most of that slim territory - it delivers a personal story about loss that does a great job of coloring outside the lines in vibrant blue, purple, red, and orange when it has to, especially with Leo and Raph's relationship. Play Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michaelangelo all ring true to the rhyming taglines about them that you may remember from your theme song iteration of choice, but this tale also sees the soon-to-be-20-something turtles facing the challenges of fighting without their brothers. That's because all of the levels are solo missions, each carried out by a pre-determined turtle on his own turf. I'm disappointed with how exactly Tactical Takedown chose to reckon with that theme of isolation in its third act, but it does give every brother a chance to shine on their own while fighting. Each unit, including the Turtles, looks like a static figurine on a grid-based board, almost like what you'd get from a tabletop game. They're more animated than static game pieces, shifting poses based on their attacks, the last action they took, or what kind of status effect they may have, but are mostly still. It's a clever, lo-fi homage to the Turtles' static origins in the panels of Eastman and Laird's comics, but a zoomed-out camera obscures the personality you'd expect from the colorful, action figure-like combatants. Couple that with a surprising lack of voice acting, these often larger-than-life caricatures of teenagers can feel more like lifeless game pieces.

Although the adolescent ninjas all have six health points, six action points to spend on stuff like moving and attacking each turn, and three arcade-style continues for when the going gets tough, they have distinct movesets that play into their weapons and personalities well as they disrupt the Foot in their territory. Leo's straightforward prowess over martial arts gives him a satisfyingly rhythmic flow that matches up nicely with the tight lanes of the subway. Dispensing debuffs that set up a more devastating blow on the next action, while stacking a buff that allows him to evade any attack, made him my favorite as I cleared a few of his missions without taking a single hit. Meanwhile, Donnie's complex but rewarding traps and map control made poisonous sewer water my ally. It was fun to use his kunai attack to stop Foot ninja when they were waist-deep in the toxic sewage, then knock away at their health from dry ground with his bo staff while throwing out electrical traps to keep my perimeter safe. Raph's powerful bursts of strength suited the small Manhattan rooftops well as I kicked ninja to their doom, which granted a buff that let me deal extra damage and collect extra action points with his sai attack. Then, I'd cannonball into another group of enemies, sending out a damaging shockwave and dishing out a debuff that let me deal extra damage to every enemy around me, reaping even more action points. Finally, Mikey's skateboard made him a dependably acrobatic street fighter whose mobility made it easy to jet from one end of a stage to the other before kicking obstacles at Foot ninja like in a classic martial arts movie. Which classic cartoon show should get a tactics game next? Transformers Thundercats Street Sharks Biker Mice from Mars Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results Every turtle has extra unlockable abilities to buy from a shop using shells, which are doled out based on your performance in each level, but they don't feel necessary to reach the end on your first try - in fact, I didn't even notice the shop until after I rolled credits on Tactical Takedown's 6-ish-hour campaign. It wasn't until I started chasing high scores in a few levels that I realized how transformative those new abilities could be, and I loved how customizable each turtle's moveset ultimately felt. My favorite added useful moves to Raph's kit that came with downside of damaging himself, but then paired with less powerful attacks that had a vampiric healing effect to balance things out. Building new loadouts also highlighted something that annoyed me about Tactical Takedown, though: Communication, or lack thereof (ironically, a core theme of this turtles story). This take on TMNT doesn't make important gameplay elements clear in some moments, which can be a widowmaker in any game where strategy is king. For example, new moves only describe their range or area of effect (ie: 1-meter cone) rather than showing you what that shape or range might look like on the tactics grid. Another move I discovered applied a debuff I hadn't seen yet, but it didn't say what that debuff actually did, frustratingly leaving me to find out a few turns into a battle. Basic tooltips like this have been in strategy games for years, making their absence even more confusing and frustrating. "" I loved how customizable each turtle's moveset felt. These issues aren't nearly as pronounced when you're actually in the heat of a battle, but they still pop up in frustrating ways. Instead of just showing what buffs or debuffs an enemy has when hovering over them with your cursor, like most other contemporary strategy games, you need to enter a separate inspection mode to figure out what that move you just used did to the Foot ninja you're about to take out. Thankfully, you can always hit tab before using a move to check exactly what it does. But other stats, like a Turtle's likelihood to dodge incoming attacks, which happened at random, just weren't clear enough to me. Once I wrapped my mind around what each buff and debuff did, I got into a comfortable rhythm with Tactical Takedown. These effects are visualized on the board by altering the game piece-like characters, each causing different poses or cartoonish flourishes that add some rare life and personality, which eventually made it so I didn't need to tab over a move to remind myself of a specific effect every other turn. Things also become easier to track because Tactical Takedown doesn't really grow or evolve after the first hour or so. Once you've played each Turtle's first level, you'll have seen a surprising chunk of the enemy types, obstacles, and design ideas the whole package has to offer. This leaves all sense of progression to wholly optional unlocks and the small bites of story, and there's never much of a challenge until the very last level. Such a narrow scope reflects that of a classic TMNT beat-em-up, and like those bygone classics (and Shredder's Revenge), Tactical Takedown largely gets by on the merit of its combat and how accurately it nails the feel of each character. Fully clearing the board of Foot soldiers in a single turn using a masterful understanding of each Turtle's moveset was consistently satisfying and enjoyable, but I still kicked the same nameless ninja off of a lot of different rooftops. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Screenshots View 9 Images Tactical Takedown further echoes those classics by grading your performance in each level with an arcade-style scoring system. Each takedown adds to a multiplier, further encouraging that hunt for a satisfying screen wipe. And once you've cleared a level, your number of KOs, remaining continues, and total damage will contribute to both a final score and the amount of shells you'll earn to spend in the shop. Each mission comes with a par score to shoot for or surpass, which was a fun motivator to get me back in action and try some levels with new movesets. The places where this formula breaks from its arcade inspirations don't do it any favors, either. Disappointingly, it doesn't have that many boss fights - and what few are present are saved for the very end and aren't very memorable (except for the very last one), which only worsens that stale feeling. But the lack of a meaningful team-up makes for an even worse break from canon than the sparse bosses. While I understand that Tactical Takedown is all about the Turtles growing apart, it's frustrating that we never get to see the Turtles at their best: Together. Tactical Takedown partially remedies this in its fourth chapter, but not in a very satisfying way."
South Africa's president praised for staying calm during Trump's Oval Office ambush - NPR,general,South Africans credit President Cyril Ramaphosa for keeping his cool as President Trump made a choreographed presentation accusing the country of murdering white farmers.,Kate Bartlett,NPR,2025-05-22T12:54:26+00:00,"South Africa's president is praised for staying calm during Trump's Oval Office ambush toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP JOHANNESBURG - ""All in all it was awful but it could have been worse,"" was how one South African newspaper summed up President Cyril Ramaphosa's extraordinary Oval Office meeting with ...","['south', 'trump', 'african', 'ramaphosa', 'white']",https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5406758/shock-and-anger-in-south-africa-after-oval-office-ambush,"South Africa's president is praised for staying calm during Trump's Oval Office ambush toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP JOHANNESBURG - ""All in all it was awful but it could have been worse,"" was how one South African newspaper summed up President Cyril Ramaphosa's extraordinary Oval Office meeting with President Trump on Wednesday. Many South Africans - including members of the government delegation visiting Washington - had feared a repeat of February's heated exchange between Trump and and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But despite what another newspaper called ""serious provocation"" by Trump - which included the dramatic moment he asked to dim the lights and played a lengthy video montage purporting to prove what Trump falsely claimed was a ""genocide"" against South African white farmers - Ramaphosa kept his cool. The South African leader, who was a protege of Nelson Mandela, has experience with intense negotiations. He was one of the key mediators in the talks that ended apartheid in 1994. Sponsor Message Most of the country's media as well as many social media users are praising Ramaphosa for remaining calm and polite throughout what's widely being called the ""ambush"" by Trump, though some wished he had hit back harder. ""Who among us did not also secretly yearn to see Ramaphosa fight back a little more?"" writer Rebecca Davis asked in the Daily Maverick newspaper. Ramaphosa himself tried to put a positive spin on things at a press briefing later on Wednesday. He said behind closed doors, at the lunch that followed the Oval Office drama, things had gone well. Trump might still attend a summit of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations in Johannesburg later this year, he said, adding they had also had good trade talks. ""I know that many South Africans were filled with concern and fear that we will have a 'Z' moment,"" the president said, apparently referring to Zelenskyy, ""and all that did not ensue."" He added that he was sorry to disappoint the South African press corps who had traveled to Washington and wanted to see some ""drama."" That prompted one reporter to say: ""Mr. President ... I don't know what constitutes drama in your book, but that was very dramatic."" Another reporter told Ramaphosa he deserved a stiff drink. Sponsor Message Debunking disinformation Despite the South African delegation's attempts to explain the facts to the U.S. leader, Trump again and again repeated a right-wing conspiracy theory that there is systematic persecution and ""genocide"" of white South Africans, using disinformation to support his allegations. He misrepresented a video showing a protest, where people placed white crosses in a field to commemorate a farmer and his wife who were murdered in a 2020 home robbery, as a ""burial site."" South African news site News24 said there are no bodies at the site and the number of crosses do not relate to the number of killings. Trump also played clips of two controversial South African opposition politicians - who in no way speak for the government - singing songs from the struggle against apartheid, including one called ""Kill the Boer,"" which means Afrikaner or farmer. One of the politicians, firebrand Julius Malema, heads a flailing opposition party that won just over 9.5% of the vote in last year's elections. Trump asked why he wasn't arrested. In fact, Malema was taken to court on charges of hate speech for singing the song at rallies, and the constitutional court ruled the singing of the song was protected by freedom of speech. Malema seems to have delighted in his 15-minutes of Oval Office fame, posting on X: ""A group of older men gathered in Washington to gossip about me."" Trump later handed Ramaphosa a bunch of printed articles that he said showed ""death, death, horrible death."" News outlets in South Africa, as well as the Agence France-Presse news agency, studied the articles and found some were from partisan blogs and unsubstantiated online sources. One article Trump held up, saying it was about ""white farmers being burned,"" was in fact about the Democratic Republic of Congo. toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP About those golfers Whatever one's take on the meeting, it has dominated social media feeds. White South African right-wing groups - and MAGA commentators - applauded Trump for repeating their talking points on race relations. Some far-left groups denounced Ramaphosa for bringing white South African businessmen and golf stars along to the meeting. Sponsor Message Ramaphosa and Trump are both avid golfers, and the presence of former world No. 1 Ernie Els and two-time U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen was a tactic the South African team hoped would defuse tensions at the meeting. Els is a personal friend of Trump's and is reported to have helped Ramaphosa get the White House meeting. Also present was South Africa's richest man, business mogul Johann Rupert, also a white Afrikaaner and a friend of both presidents. Rupert won some praise from South African media for telling Trump ""it's not only white farmers"" who are victims of violent crime, ""it's across the board,"" and stating that non-whites are in fact the biggest victims. Ramaphosa's white agriculture minister, John Steenhuisen, also challenged Trump, telling him most white farmers wanted to remain in South Africa. But the golfers angered many. Els seemed to support Trump's narrative of white persecution, referring to the apartheid era but adding: ""I don't think two wrongs makes a right."" He also thanked the U.S. for supporting South Africa during its war with Angola - but as social media users were quick to point out, that support had been for the old apartheid regime. A Daily Maverick journalist wrote that the men were talented golfers but ""what the hell do they have to do with international relations?"" Reporters asked Ramaphosa after the meeting if the golfers should not have been better prepped. He defended them as patriots, but admitted they could have been. What is particularly galling to many though, is Trump's derisive treatment of the head of state of a constitutional democracy. Several local newspaper articles pointed out he doesn't treat authoritarian leaders with dubious human rights records like he treated the South African president."
How £125m Tottenham Hotspur Europa League win saved season and summer transfer plans - Football London,general,Spurs have reasons to be cheerful after emerging triumphant over Manchester United in Bilbao,Dave Powell,Football.London,2025-05-22T12:30:47+00:00,"Don't miss any of the latest and best Spurs news - sign up to the free Tottenham newsletter for updates straight to your inbox Don't miss any of the latest and best Spurs news - sign up to the free Tottenham newsletter for updates straight to your inbox To the victors, the spoils.

Last night saw Tottenham Hotspur were crowned Europa League champions after a 1-0 win over Manchester United at the Estadio de San Mames in Bilbao. It was Spurs' first piece of silverware since 2008 and the first European crown since 1984. It was truly a moment to savour for Spurs fans, players and their embattled head coach Ange Postecoglou, who may still have run out of time to save himself from an exit from the club at the end of this season. Football is all about the glory, of course. But money makes a big difference in terms of how quickly that success can be achieved in the modern game, and last night's final clash in Spain was a game of high stakes for both. This Premier League campaign has almost reached its conclusion and for both Spurs and Manchester United it has been one of utter misery, with both clubs at risk of being the team to finish just one spot above the drop zone. For two of the supposed big six', agitators of the European Super League four years ago, it has been a season of staggering underachievement. From pretty early on it was apparent that the Europa League run would be of huge importance due to the fact that there was a route through to the league phase of the UEFA Champions League and its riches next season for the winners of the competition. Both clubs needed it for different reasons. Spurs, while not at risk of breaching the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) or UEFA's squad cost ratio rule, needed a cash boost to allow them to better cash flow the business into next season when it came to bringing in new talent without having to aggressively player trade in order to do so. For Spurs, winning the Europa League final last night was worth 125m. For a Europa League success, Spurs have received, through participation fees, prize money and the value pillar that dishes out funds based on league market size and coefficients, a sum of 35.4m. Taking into account matchday revenue for the home games played in the competition, average ticket income per home game of 4.9m for Spurs, that has provided additional revenue of 34.3m. That brings the total prize pot for Europa League success to 69.7m for Spurs, and that is before taking into account how transformative Champions League revenue can be to clubs. Qualification for the Champions League yields enormous success. With participation alone worth 15.6m and every victory and draw in the revamped competition's league phase delivering an additional 1.7m and 580,000. Just making it to the league phase can bring in, conservatively, around 20m, and that is before factoring in any progression to the knockout stages, where the money continues on a steep incline. The Champions League value pillar is more lucrative than that of the Europa League and is worth another 20m to clubs. Matchday revenue then plays another significant role. Playing in the league phase guarantees four home games for each team, adding 19.6m to Spurs, and that is before any knockout games or money for progression comes into play. And what about the summer window? Well, for Spurs, it has just become a whole lot easier to plan for a revamp or rebuild, with the additional income able to offset some of the pain of a far lower merit payment that will be received this season, with the club potentially looking at a drop in central payments from the Premier League related to their finishing position of as much as 31.5m based on last year's figures. But prize money from the Champions League and the additional home games in the league phase that will effectively wipe out that loss, means that the club can engage in the market, because they had a real problem to solve if they would have fallen to defeat in Bilbao on Wednesday evening. Much of Spurs' transfer debt has been on credit in recent years, and as of the 2023/24 accounts, published last month, the transfer payables, which is the money the club owes to other clubs still for transfer fees, stood at 337m, an increase of around 250m from the 88m it stood at back in 2019, the year they moved into their new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium home. Sitting behind only Chelsea's 479m, Spurs' transfer debt is the second largest in the Premier League. In terms of what is coming the other way, Spurs are owed 58m in transfer receivables from clubs, meaning that there is a 279m difference between the two, and that is not insignificant. Given the way that PSR looks at allowable losses of 105m with permitted deductions for investment into infrastructure, the women's team, the academy and community initiatives, Spurs' heavy debt, much of it attributable to the new stadium, means that they are still in a good PSR spot, especially given their significant commercial and matchday revenue, and the low wages to revenue ratio that they have. But cash in the bank as of March 31, 2024, stood at 79m, down from 198m the previous financial year. Spurs have been eating into the cash reserve in the past 18 months, and there was the potential of another lean year if they had missed out on the Champions League next season. They didn't, though, and while it's hard to paint the season as a storming success, a trophy and Champions League football means Spurs can be more active in the market and it makes them more attractive to potential new signings, as well as commercial partners who either are looking to renew or come on board for the first time. Potential investors, too, would also value the return to the top table of European club football. Spurs have managed to salvage real hope from the wreckage of a dismal domestic campaign. They'll have to learn some major lessons from it."

No cause of death was given. Irsay had battled health issues in recent years. When he appeared at the Indianapolis Colts' training camp last summer, it was his first public appearance since the previous season, The Indianapolis Star reported, and he told the Star that he had been recuperating after having undergone several operations following a fall at his home. Irsay was 13 when his father, Robert, bought the Baltimore Colts in 1972. When the franchise moved to Indianapolis in 1984, the younger Irsay was named vice president and general manager; he became its chief operating officer in 1996. Upon his father's death in 1997, Irsay took over his family's business as the team's owner and chief executive. His time in ownership overlapped with the arrival of quarterback Peyton Manning, who led the Colts to a win in the Super Bowl in 2007. ""Jim's love and appreciation for the NFL, in addition to its history, tradition and principles influenced him to become a steward of the game throughout his 50-plus years in the League,"" the Colts said in a statement. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement that he was ""deeply saddened."" ""He spent his life and career in the National Football League,"" Goodell said. ""Starting as a teenager as a Colts' ballboy, he learned every position in the organization before assuming leadership of the Colts approximately 30 years ago. Jim's Colts won the Super Bowl, hosted another and built Lucas Oil Stadium."" Beyond football, Irsay was known for his collection of pop culture, historic and music artifacts, including guitars played by John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Prince; a first edition of Allen Ginsberg's poem ""Howl""; and items used by presidents. He had also spoken candidly about his history of addiction. In 2023, he told HBO's ""Real Sports"" that he had been in rehab at least 15 times and had once accidentally overdosed. Irsay is survived by daughters, Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson."

But instead of wearing smart glasses at the Vienna State Opera and hearing Tom Cruise's voice, I was standing in a 5-by-5-foot wooden shed at the Google's I/O developer conference with Gemini AI in my ear. I got to test out a pair of Android XR glasses that look like something Poindexter from Revenge of the Nerds would wear. In the right lens, there's tiny white text displaying the time and weather: 2:24 p.m., 73 degrees. If this were all that smart glasses could do, I'd be happy. But that was just the home screen. Next, I used the prototype frames to take a photo and view a full-color preview, right on one of the lenses. It was wild to simultaneously see a picture and then the actual world through it. The futuristic frames are a very early prototype of the Android XR glasses that Google is making in partnership with Samsung and Qualcomm. In nearly every way, these frames look like normal prescription glasses. In fact, Google announced it'll work with Warby Parker (my go-to glasses brand for years) and swanky South Korean eyeglass brand Gentle Monster (Beyonce and Rihanna wear them) for actual frame designs when they ship. Unlike regular glasses, these frames are loaded with tech. There's a microphone and speaker that can be used to dictate prompts for Gemini and listen to the responses. On the top edge of the temple, there's a physical camera shutter button. You can interact with the sides of the frames. And the glasses are packed with sensors that interpret your movements as input, so that Google Maps, for instance, show you directions, no matter which direction you're looking. Until now, I've shrugged off other smart glasses like an annoying invite to a friend's improv comedy show. They don't seem worth the effort and price. However, these may be the turning point. Google is striving to make Android XR frames stir up interest beyond just early adopters looking for an alternative to Meta's Ray-ban smart glasses. During my brief encounter, I left thinking that there's definitely potential for wider appeal here, especially if Google can get more people to try them. The controls seemed intuitive like a natural extension of an Android phone. Years from now, I envision going to the eye doctor and being asked if you want the optional Android XR and Gemini addition -- in much the way we are now asked if we want a coating for blue light. The standout feature to me is the tiny display on the right lens of Google's glasses. But describing how the display works on these frames approaches Defcon 1 levels of technical mastery, so I enlisted some help. As Luke Skywalker has Yoda, I have CNET's Scott Stein, who's seen it all when it comes to AR and VR glasses and headsets. Turns out he got to try a similar prototype of these glasses last year. ""These glasses have a single display in the right lens, projected in via a Micro LED chip on the arm onto etched waveguides on a small square patch on the lens glass,"" Stein told me. This display is where the magic happens. Not only can it show an Android XR interface and animations, but it does so in color -- even with the few photos that I got to take. Also I was impressed with how the UI disappeared when I wasn't directly using it. Google's Gemini is built into XR, so I can ask my glasses to give me more information on whatever I'm looking at. In the Lilliputian-size demo shed, I asked Gemini about a couple of paintings on the wall. I could hear responses via the speaker that's nestled in the glasses' temple, but those around me couldn't hear anything. It definitely made me feel like a spy. Google showed off this video during its I/O keynote showing how maps looks when wearing a pair of Android XR glasses. Google Then I got to try Google Maps. I never knew getting directions could be so enjoyable. I saw a circular map with street names and an arrow pointing in the direction I should go. As I moved, the little map rotated. It felt a bit like moving the camera in a video game with a controller to get a better view. And that was it. Any initial skepticism I had for smart glasses was wiped away. But I do have questions. How long does a pair of these glasses last on a single charge? Am I supposed to use these as my everyday frames? Should I have a second regular pair of glasses to wear when I charge them so that I can see? And how much is a pair going to cost me? Will there be a rise in people walking into walls because they're distracted by whatever they're interacting with on their lenses? Google doesn't have much to share with me yet, so I guess we'll find out more in the coming months and years. I spent about 5 minutes in the frames, but if you want to know more, check out this more in-depth look at Android XR by CNET's resident smart glasses expert, Scott Stein."

Friends and fellow Ars staffers who had them would gush about them at every opportunity, talking about how useful they can be and how much can be printed once you get used to the idea of being able to create real, tangible objects with a little time and a few bucks' worth of plastic filament. But I could never quite imagine myself using one consistently enough to buy one. Then, this past Christmas, my wife forced the issue by getting me a Bambu Lab A1 as a present. Since then, I've been tinkering with the thing nearly daily, learning more about what I've gotten myself into and continuing to find fun and useful things to print. I've gathered a bunch of thoughts about my learning process here, not because I think I'm breaking new ground but to serve as a blueprint for anyone who has been on the fence about Getting Into 3D Printing. ""Hyperfixating on new hobbies"" is one of my go-to coping mechanisms during times of stress and anxiety, and 3D printing has turned out to be the perfect combination of fun, practical, and time-consuming. Getting to know my printer My wife settled on the Bambu A1 because it's a larger version of the A1 Mini, Wirecutter's main 3D printer pick at the time (she also noted it was ""hella on sale""). Other reviews she read noted that it's beginner-friendly, easy to use, and fun to tinker with, and it has a pretty active community for answering questions, all assessments I agree with so far. Note that this research was done some months before Bambu earned bad headlines because of firmware updates that some users believe will lead to a more locked-down ecosystem. This is a controversy I understand-3D printers are still primarily the realm of DIYers and tinkerers, people who are especially sensitive to the closing of open ecosystems. But as a beginner, I'm already leaning mostly on the first-party tools and built-in functionality to get everything going, so I'm not really experiencing the sense of having ""lost"" features I was relying on, and any concerns I did have are mostly addressed by Bambu's update about its update."

On Tuesday, the United Kingdom government suspended free trade negotiations with Israel in response to its military conduct in the war on Gaza and the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Addressing the parliament, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK government couldn't continue talks on upgrading its existing trade agreement with an Israeli government pursuing what he called ""egregious policies"" in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. This came a day after the UK, France and Canada threatened to take ""concrete actions"" against Israel if it does not stop its renewed offensive and lift aid restrictions in Gaza. Meanwhile, the European Union has also taken a step towards reassessing its relationship with Israel with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas confirming on Tuesday that the bloc had voted to review its trade cooperation agreement. How much is Israel-UK trade worth? The United Kingdom and Israel embarked on negotiations for a modernised Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in July 2022, aiming to enhance their economic partnership by addressing areas not covered in their existing trade agreement, particularly services and digital trade. Advertisement According to United Nations Comtrade, a global database of official international trade statistics, in 2024, the UK ranked as Israel's 11th largest import partner, with imports totalling some $1.96bn. The main products imported from the UK included machinery such as jet engines, electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals and vehicles. Conversely, the UK was Israel's eighth largest export destination, receiving Israeli exports valued at about $1.57bn, primarily of diamonds, chemical products, machinery and electronics.

Fishy origins of sensation Using 3D scans on fossils of the fish, researchers discovered that these bumps were sensitive and were likely used to sense their environment, like detecting cold water or pressure from nearby objects. While studying the fossils, the team also found that odontodes in ancient fish looked a lot like sensilla - tiny sensory organs found in the shells of animals like crabs and shrimp. Sensilla are also seen in fossils of ancient invertebrates. Surprisingly, these two features evolved in completely different animal groups: fish, which have backbones, and arthropods, which don't. According to Dr. Yara Haridy, who led the study, this is a classic case of evolutionary convergence - when different species develop similar traits on their own."

Confident Investing Starts Here: Easily unpack a company's performance with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter But this week's Google I/O conference helped flip the script. The company unveiled a slate of AI-driven innovations, making it clear it's not ceding ground - it's stepping up as a key architect of the AI era. More than anything, says Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, I/O showcased ""how the company intends to leverage its leading user bases and distribution to drive next generation more personalized search,' and agentic experiences."" Among the highlights, CEO Sundar Pichai announced that AI Mode - a conversational chatbot interface for the company's search engine that debuted in beta earlier this year - is now available to all of Google's US users. Google will also be enhancing AI Mode throughout 2025 with more agentic, commerce-focused experiences for users. Soon, users will be able to connect other Google apps, like Gmail, to enable more context-aware responses - such as suggesting events based on travel plans found in emails. Additionally, Deep Search will use Google's query expansion technology to deliver expert-level, fully cited reports with unique visualizations, beginning with sports and financial data. New agentic features will help users complete tasks like booking tickets or making reservations by navigating websites and filling out forms. Search Live will let users use their phone cameras in real time so Google can assist based on what they're seeing. Lastly, next-gen shopping tools will offer a dynamic, personalized product browsing experience using Google's massive catalog, including a new AI-powered ""Try-On"" feature that shows how clothes might look on the user. ""It will be important to monitor whether these products are rolled out to all users (free vs paid) in order to gauge their potential benefits,"" Nowak said on the matter. Nowak makes the case that for GenAI platforms to drive the next wave of widespread adoption, they'll need to introduce compelling new features across their free tiers. At the same time, it's clear that the most advanced capabilities will often be reserved for paid subscriptions. Google delivered on this front, says the analyst, with the launch of Agent Mode in the Gemini app, which allows users to assign and automate multiple tasks - comparable to OpenAI's Operator functionality. Google also unveiled Imagen 4 and Veo 3, its newest image and video generation models, both now available. Imagen 4 delivers significantly higher-quality images - up to 10 times faster than Imagen 3 - along with enhanced text rendering and topography capabilities. Meanwhile, Veo 3 builds on the capabilities of Veo 2 by adding audio generation features, including dialogue, background sounds, and sound effects, for more immersive video creation. ""Near-term adoption of these tools may be small (given the required paywall access) but long-term we see how GOOGL's improving GenAI capabilities can lead to further sources of engagement and monetization for creators and advertisers,"" Nowak went on to say. With that in mind, Nowak is staying bullish on GOOGL shares, assigning an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating and a $185 price target, implying a ~10% upside from where the stock trades now. (To watch Nowak's track record, click here) 27 other analysts also take a favorable view of GOOGL's prospects, while 9 fencesitters can't detract from a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target stands at $197.69, pointing toward one-year returns of 17%.

While the tour may look a lot like Beyonce's Renaissance one, the singer has kept fans entertained by bringing out her nanny (of strawberry-jam cheating-scandal fame), singing all the deep cuts, and shaking her hips ... truthfully. But as of this week, one small hiccup has emerged. On Tuesday, the New Jersey Department of Health issued a warning about a potential measles exposure to the tens of thousands of concertgoers who schlepped across state lines to see the ""Hips Don't Lie"" singer. According to a press release, the alert stems from one non-New Jersey resident who attended the concert while actively infected with measles. The NJ DOH did not specify what section the individual was seated in but is encouraging everyone who was present at Thursday night's event to call a health-care provider regarding next steps.

The most effective way to protect against the virus is with the MMR vaccine - a two-part dose that treats measles, mumps, and rubella. But with misinformation about vaccines on the rise, and with anti-vax evangelist RFK Jr. serving as Trump's Health secretary, the country has surpassed more than 1,000 confirmed measles cases this year alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that means we're shaping up for the largest outbreak in the United States in nearly 25 years - scary enough to get RFK Jr. to admit that, actually, people should get the MMR vaccine.

The test, the first of its kind to be cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, is for people 55 and older who already have memory problems or other signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's. The results show whether the brain of a person with cognitive symptoms also has amyloid plaques, clumps of toxic proteins that build up in the spaces between brain cells. The presence of plaques in a person with cognitive symptoms usually confirms an Alzheimer's diagnosis. Sponsor Message ""I think the blood test is going to really revolutionize the way people with Alzheimer's are cared for and diagnosed,"" says Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer at the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation. ""Primary care physicians will now have access to something that can give them a quicker read"" on whether a patient has Alzheimer's, says Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Association. One benefit of a readily-available blood test will be more accurate diagnoses, Fillit says, noting that currently, primary care doctors correctly diagnose patients only about 60% of the time. ""Specialty neurologists get it right like seventy, eighty percent of the time,"" He says. ""With the blood test, we can get it up to over 90%."" A PET scan is the gold standard for detecting the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's. But the technology is costly, and unavailable in many communities. Another option is to test fluid from a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that most doctors and patients tend to avoid. There are already lab-developed blood tests that can signal the presence of amyloid. But the Lumipulse assay, made by the diagnostic company Fujirebio, is the first to receive marketing clearance from the FDA. Having such a test is likely to mean that many more people will be diagnosed when their symptoms are still mild, and potentially treatable. Sponsor Message A survey from the Alzheimer's Association found that the vast majority of older Americans would take a blood test to find out if they have the disease. People who are diagnosed while still in the early stages of Alzheimer's may be eligible to receive one of the two amyloid-reducing drugs now on market. Lab-developed blood tests have been used primarily by researchers, or by specialists in large medical centers. The test cleared by the FDA is likely to attract a much broader audience. ""It's been through rigorous evaluation, and it provides guidance for prescribers on who's eligible and when the test should be provided,"" Carrillo says. The result should be more testing of people in rural or underserved areas. ""Blood tests have given us an opportunity to really democratize this kind of testing,"" Carrillo says. It also means that many more of the estimated 7.2 million Americans thought to be living with Alzheimer's are likely to get a formal diagnosis. To help health health care providers counsel these individuals, the Alzheimer's Association is writing guidelines on how to speak to patients about the results of a blood test, what it means to live with the disease, and what the treatment options are. The guidelines are expected this summer."

These lawsuits, which were filed at the last minute by the Biden administration after President Donald Trump's reelection, accused Louisville and Minneapolis of widespread patterns of unconstitutional policing practices by wrongly equating statistical disparities with intentional discrimination and heavily relying on flawed methodologies and incomplete data. They also sought to subject the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments to sweeping consent decrees that went far beyond the Biden administration's accusations of unconstitutional conduct; the decrees would have governed many aspects of those police departments, including their management, supervision, training, performance evaluations, discipline, staffing, recruitment, and hiring. In short, these sweeping consent decrees would have imposed years of micromanagement of local police departments by federal courts and expensive independent monitors, and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of compliance costs, without a legally or factually adequate basis for doing so. ""Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,"" added Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ""Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division's failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees."" The Civil Rights Division will be taking all necessary steps to dismiss the Louisville and Minneapolis lawsuits with prejudice, to close the underlying investigations into the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, and to retract the Biden administration's findings of constitutional violations. The Civil Rights Division will also be closing its investigations into, and retracting the Biden administration's findings of constitutional violations on the part of, the following additional local police departments: Phoenix, Arizona Trenton, New Jersey Memphis, Tennessee Mount Vernon, New York Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Louisiana State Police The Department of Justice will continue to offer its full support to police departments across the country, including through grants and technical assistance. The Department is confident that the vast majority of police officers across the Nation will continue to vigorously enforce the law and protect the public in full compliance with the Constitution and all applicable federal laws. When bad actors in uniform fail to do so, the Department stands ready to take all necessary action to address any resulting constitutional or civil-rights violations, including via criminal prosecution."

The patient - a young baby who was sick because of a problem with his DNA - is now greatly improved, and is expected to go home soon. Soon after he was born, doctors knew that KJ Muldoon was struggling. Test showed that KJ's DNA had a mistake which made it hard for his body to get rid of a dangerous chemical called ammonia. Too much ammonia can damage the brain and other organs. Roughly half of the children born with this problem die while they're still babies. When the human body digests proteins, it creates ammonia. In a healthy person, the liver helps get rid of this ammonia. But because of the problem with his genes, KJ's liver couldn't get rid of ammonia. KJ was too young and small for a liver transplant, and waiting for a transplant would have been very dangerous. Doctors at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) asked KJ's parents if they wanted to try a brand new method - a special medicine made just for KJ. His parent said yes. Editing DNA DNA is a collection of information and instructions stored in a tiny chemical form. DNA tells cells, the building blocks of a body, what to do. Every living thing has DNA that causes it to grow in a certain way. Small bits of DNA, called ""genes"", help control different parts of how a living thing grows. For example, some genes might control eye color. Some genes work by themselves, others work together. Some may help control more than one thing. In recent years, scientists have made great progress in their ability to ""edit"" DNA. CRISPR is a tool that allows scientists to cut out or change a piece of DNA. Editing DNA is tricky and complicated. Scientists at Penn Medicine had been working on the idea of creating medicines to fix the genes of a single patient. Now they had a chance to really try it. But the pressure was on, since there wasn't much time to help KJ. The researchers studied KJ's DNA. The problem was like fixing one misspelled letter in a word that's three billion letters long. With the help of lots of scientists pitching in and working long hours, soon they had developed a CRISPR tool for editing KJ's DNA. Next, they tested the new medicine on mice and monkeys. The results were positive - the new treatment helped the animals and appeared safe. After just six months, the new medicine was approved by the FDA. During this time, KJ had been getting medicine and special treatment to help lower his ammonia levels. KJ was six months old when he got the first small dose of the new medicine, which was designed to reach his liver and make one tiny change to his DNA. Soon after the first treatment, KJ was able to eat protein without raising his body's levels of ammonia. The positive results led his doctors to give KJ two more doses. KJ has gained weight and is now much healthier. Soon, the hospital expects him to go home for the first time in his life. KJ isn't completely cured. He may need to keep taking medicine, and one day he may need a liver transplant. But he is in far better shape now than when he was born. Scientists and doctors are extremely excited about the results. In just six months, the researchers and the companies they worked with were able to create a special DNA-editing medicine for a single patient. In the past, that work would have taken 10 years or longer. The project isn't only a success for KJ. It also brings hope to millions of other people who have conditions that might be treated by similar methods. Did You Know...? The treatment for KJ was made possible by decades of research paid for by the US government. Fyodor Urnov, one of the scientists involved, said, ""I don't think this could have happened in any country other than the US."" Several of the companies involved helped out for free."

Subscribe No matter how well we think we understand the Universe, there's always something new out there to discover. After all, astronomy is the study of the Universe as we observe it to be, and as we build superior instruments and telescopes, we're bound to notice details, objects, and even phenomena that couldn't be revealed with the tools of prior generations. In many regards, it was only with the advent of space telescope technology - including NASA's Hubble Space Telescope - that we began to understand what the Universe looked like. Now, here in the 2020s, it's the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that's taking us beyond all of Hubble's prior limits, discovering fainter, more distant, more primitive, and younger objects in the Universe than ever before. Back in 2022, before JWST began science operations, we had only one confirmed galaxy from the first 500 million years of cosmic history: GN-z11, discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. Several other ultra-distant galaxy candidates existed, but they were just that: candidates. It would take a superior tool, like JWST, to find others, as well as to confirm or refute the ones we already had. Fast forward to today: in 2025. GN-z11 is still an ultra-distant galaxy, but it's not even in the top 10 anymore for most distant galaxy. Hundreds of times as many luminous, early galaxies were found as were initially expected, and a new record holder, MoM-z14, was just announced on May 16, 2025. Here's what we found, what it means, and what puzzles still remain. This image shows the full COSMOS (Cosmic Evolution Survey) from the Hubble Space Telescope: its largest ever survey of the Universe. Hubble photographed 575 adjacent and slightly overlapping views of the universe using the Advanced Camera for Surveys' (ACS) Wide Field Camera onboard Hubble, requiring nearly 1000 hours of observations. At full resolution the image would be 100,800 x 100,800 pixels. Credit: NASA, ESA and A. Koekemoer (STScI) What you see, above, is what's known as the COSMOS survey: the Cosmic Evolution Survey, which is the largest deep survey of the Universe, to date, ever conducted. Constructed from a whopping 575 separate adjacent, overlapping Hubble images requiring nearly 1000 hours of total observing time, the full-resolution version of this field clocks in at over 10 Gigapixels, or more than 100,000 pixels per side. And yet, the sky is so vast that if we wanted to cover it all, it would require the equivalent of more than 20,000 COSMOS surveys to do it. Nevertheless, within this field-of-view, an enormous number of ultra-distant galaxy candidates have been identified. While the closer galaxies can be spectroscopically confirmed from the ground - such as with the Magellan telescope, the Subaru telescope, the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, or the Very Large Telescope - the light from the most distant galaxies of all experience such severe redshifts, or stretching effects owing to the expansion of the Universe, that a new observatory is required to measure them. JWST, humanity's most powerful infrared space telescope in history, is ideally suited to this task. Already, before it began considering galaxies in the COSMOS field, JWST discovered and confirmed an enormous number of bright, ultra-distant galaxies in the Universe: so many that they're approximately ~100 times more abundant than we had expected before the dawn of the JWST science era. JADES-GS-z14-0, in the top inset box, is found behind (and just to the right of) a closer, brighter, bluer galaxy. It was only through the power of JWST spectroscopy with incredible resolution, capable of separating the two sources, that the nature of this record-breakingly distant object could be determined. Its light comes to us from when the Universe was only 285-290 million years old: just 2.1% of its current age. JADES-GS-z14-1, just below it, comes from when the Universe was ~300 million years old. Compared to large, modern-day galaxies, all early galaxies contain a paucity of stars and have irregular, ill-defined shapes. Credit: S. Carniani et al. (JADES collaboration), arXiv:2405.18485, 2024 The most common ""type"" of ultra-distant galaxy found by JWST is illustrated above: what we know as ""little red dot"" galaxies. Initially, when we first began discovering them (which was practically immediately), many jumped to the premature conclusion that cosmology is broken, and we didn't know how galaxies formed or grew up at all. As more data poured in and more research was conducted, however, four partial explanations emerged for what JWST was seeing. Optical overperformance. The galaxies we were seeing were brighter and more numerous than anticipated, in part, because JWST was gathering more light (and was kept cleaner during construction) than we expected. Simulation limitations. Most simulations were conducted at medium-resolution, without focusing on the most rare but most severe small-scale overdensities. When these ""rarepeak"" regions are included in simulations, more bright, early galaxies are expected. Bursty star-formation. Most models for galaxies rely on a constant, maximal rate of star-formation that builds up over time. But realistic galaxies often exceed those rates temporarily, forming stars in great (but brief) bursts, temporarily enhancing their brightness. Then, it's the brightest ones at that time that we preferentially observe. AGN enhancements. Nearly all galaxies, even early-type galaxies, are anticipated to have supermassive black holes at their centers, many (but not all) of which are either currently or recently active. As a result, many of these little red dot galaxies are brightness-enhanced by AGN activity, artificially (but temporarily) inflating their observed brightnesses. With these four contributions, all combined, the Universe finally makes sense, even with the abundant presence of these ultra-distant JWST galaxies. This image shows 15 of the 341 hitherto identified ""little red dot"" galaxies discovered in the distant Universe by JWST. These galaxies all exhibit similar features, but only exist very early on in cosmic history; there are no known examples of such galaxies close by or at late times. All of them are quite massive, but some are compact while others are extended, and some show evidence for AGN activity while others do not. Credit: D. Kocevski et al., Astrophysical Journal Letters accepted/arXiv:2404.03576, 2025 Previously, JWST collaborations such as CEERS (the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey), GLASS, UNCOVER (the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization), and JADES (the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey) had all discovered many galaxies surpassing the previously-held record of GN-z11. These very distant galaxies included: along with many other finds that are revolutionizing our picture for how the Universe grew up. And with that, it's now time to add to the story further with the newest discovery: galaxy MoM-z14, which surpasses JADES-GS-z14-0 as the most distant galaxy presently known to humanity as of May 16, 2025. Like most of the ultra-distant JWST galaxies discovered, it was imaged photometrically first, at a variety of near-infrared wavelengths: 0.9 microns, 1.15 microns, 1.50 microns, 2.00 microns, 2.77 microns, 3.56 microns, and 4.44 microns. Because of the neutral hydrogen present in the Universe this early on, all light of wavelengths shorter than ~121 nanometers (where the Lyman- emission/absorption transition occurs) gets absorbed, and then the light gets stretched by the expansion of the Universe. For this object, that means that the first three filters reveal no light at all, but that the latter four filters reveal this object. This figure shows the NIRCam (top) and NIRSpec (bottom) data for now-confirmed galaxy MoM-z14: the most distant galaxy known to date as of May 2025. Completely invisible at wavelengths of 1.5 microns and below, its light is stretched by the expansion of the Universe. Emission features of various ionized atoms can be seen in the spectrum, below, as well as the significant and strong Lyman break feature. Credit: R.P. Naidu et al., Open Journal of Astrophysics (submitted)/arXiv:2505.11263, 2025 To measure the true distance to the galaxy, we then need to perform what we call a spectroscopic follow-up: where we break the light from this object up into its individual component wavelengths. With the incredible spectroscopic power of JWST's NIRSpec instrument, even a galaxy that's this far away will exhibit emission lines from the ionized atoms surrounding it. This is because of a confluence of facts. This galaxy has already formed previous generations of stars, meaning that heavy elements such as nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen are present, in addition to the primordial signs of hydrogen and helium. This galaxy, in order to be observed so far away, must be actively forming stars either right now or extremely recently, implying there are large numbers of ultraviolet photons, which can strip one or several electrons away from the atoms present. As electrons recombine with their ionized nuclei, they cascade down a variety of atomic energy levels, emitting ""lines"" at a telltale set of frequencies and wavelengths. And every one of those lines, if our instruments can resolve them, will reveal a galaxy's redshift (z) because the observed wavelengths of those lines will be at the rest-frame wavelength multiplied by a factor of ""1+redshift"" (or 1+z). With not just the Lyman break feature, corresponding to the Lyman- wavelength, but with emission lines from nitrogen, carbon, helium, and oxygen in various ionization states all observed for this object, we can definitively conclude that it's at a redshift of z = 14.44, which sets a brand new cosmic record. This image shows the best fit to the Lyman break feature (top left), the best fit to the identified ionized emission lines (top right), the redshift inferred from photometry, the Lyman break, and the emission lines (lower left), and the probability density of the galaxy MoM-z14 actually being at those particular redshifts (lower right). The most likely redshift peaks at z = 14.44. Credit: R.P. Naidu et al., Open Journal of Astrophysics (submitted)/arXiv:2505.11263, 2025 A redshift of z = 14.44 means that light, originally emitted from this object with a specific wavelength, will be observed by us here on Earth (or in space with JWST) with a wavelength that is a factor of 15.44 times as great. For the Lyman- line, emitted at 121.5 nanometers, that light was initially ultraviolet. But owing to the expansion of the Universe, that light gets stretched and stretched and stretched over a journey of more than 13.5 billion years, out of the ultraviolet (which ends at about 400 nm), into visible light (from 400-700 nm) and all the way into the infrared, where finally that signal begins appearing at a new wavelength of 1.88 microns. This corresponds to an age of the Universe of approximately 282 million years, or just 2.0% of its current age. It corresponds to a light-travel time of about 13.53 billion years, which means that this object is now located at a distance of 33.8 billion light-years from us, making it the single most distant object ever yet discovered in the Universe. Because we understand how the expanding Universe works, we can infer additional properties about this galaxy as well, including its size (it has a diameter of right around 500 light-years), its compact nature (its light is very concentrated and not diffuse, or extended), and its surprisingly dust-free nature (due to the steep ultraviolet slope from its light). This figure shows the inferred absolute (intrinsic) brightness of the most distant galaxies confirmed spectroscopically, with redshift shown on the x-axis and brightness/magnitude shown on the y-axis. The squares denote galaxies whose infrared images are depicted atop. GN-z11, the most distant galaxy known in 2022, is now just the 14th most distant known. Credit: R.P. Naidu et al., Open Journal of Astrophysics (submitted)/arXiv:2505.11263, 2025 This ""dust-free"" nature is already an extremely interesting property. Remember: before JWST started observing the ultra-distant Universe, we expected to find very few of these bright galaxies at such great distances. It took a combination of four factors to explain it: optical overperformance of JWST, improved simulations, bursty star-formation, and AGN (or active galactic nuclei) enhancement of the brightness. Well, the way AGNs typically work is by injecting energy into an accretion disk, heating it up and causing it to glow, which enhances the overall brightness of the galaxy. But this would make the ultraviolet slope of its light very shallow, and would cause the galaxy to appear quite extended in space; neither of which describes the light from the galaxy that we're observing. This implies that an AGN is not only not the dominant source of light for this object, but that there may be only negligible amounts of light coming from the central supermassive black hole. In fact, several of the early ""little red dot"" galaxies that JWST has found seem to exhibit little-to-no evidence for AGN activity: particularly the smaller, more compact ones in general. If there's no AGN activity inside this object, then one would hope - or would even require - that there would be strong evidence of an ongoing or very recent episode of bursty star-formation inside this galaxy. It's very clear, from this set of images, that there are two distinct populations of ultra-distant galaxy that have emerged in the JWST era: large, extended galaxies with weak triply-ionized nitrogen signals (yellow), and small, compact, strong triply-ionized nitrogen emitters (blue), with newly discovered galaxy MoM-z14 being the most distant galaxy and the strongest nitrogen emitter of all. Credit: R.P. Naidu et al., Open Journal of Astrophysics (submitted)/arXiv:2505.11263, 2025 And indeed, that's exactly what the evidence shows. It looks like the star-formation rate underwent a rapid increase, by a factor of 10 or even more, over a period no longer than the past 10 million years, and has remained at this elevated value for at least the last 3-4 million years. This also explains why: the equivalent widths (an astronomical term for how much of the continuum intensity is needed to make up the total intensity of an observed emission line) of the emission lines detected, such as doubly ionized carbon, are so large (at about ~15 A), there's a very high degree of ionization (and hence, many atomic species are found with double or triple ionization states), a very high inferred gas density (some twenty times higher than for the gas-depleted former distance record-holder, JADES-GS-z14-0) is present, and why so much of the galaxy's energy is found being emitted in the form of triply-ionized nitrogen: more than in any other (even much larger) galaxies found at such great distances. Although we cannot yet know with current observations (although future NIRSpec and/or ALMA observations might be able to find out) whether there is a population of older stars present alongside these newly-forming ones, we can strongly conclude that the majority of the light that we're seeing from this galaxy was from stars that have formed relatively recently in its cosmic history: within the past 10 million years or so. Based on the data acquired for galaxy MoM-z14, we can infer that it has a mass of approximately 100,000,000 Suns, overall, and that all to nearly-all of the detectable light comes from stars that formed recently: within the past 10 million years or so. It is possible that an older population of stars exists alongside the newer ones, but these observations were insufficient to reveal either their presence or absence. Credit: R.P. Naidu et al., Open Journal of Astrophysics (submitted)/arXiv:2505.11263, 2025 All of this points to the big puzzle - or, by a different way of thinking, the big ""reveal"" - that JWST has brought to us about the early Universe: the unexpectedly large abundance of these very bright, ultra-distant galaxies. While we think we can explain them now, after they've already been discovered, it's important to recognize that our initial thoughts about how frequently we expected to find them were gross underestimates: by a factor of ~100 or even ~200. The discovery of this new galaxy, known as MoM-z14, confirms this picture very well. In addition, certain new questions are raised. The particular features of the light from this distant galaxy indicate that there's very little neutral gas present. However, the Universe shouldn't become fully reionized until some ~550 million years after the Big Bang, whereas MoM-z14 comes to us from a time when the Universe was barely half of that age. How is there so little neutral gas present in this region so early on. Is it possible that the intergalactic medium around this object somehow became fully ionized hundreds of millions of years earlier than elsewhere? Furthermore, unless there's something exotic going on at very early times, like an unexpected evolution in star-formation efficiency or the presence of some exotic form of energy (like evolving dark matter or early dark energy), even most of the JWST-inspired models have difficulty explaining the presences of MoM-z14 and JADES-GS-z14-0 at such great distances and early times. The presence of ""little red dot"" galaxies has caused us to re-evaluate just how abundant these galaxies ought to be. With better simulations and a better understanding of JWST's performance, the two major contributors to the abundance and brightness of these objects are star-formation and AGN enhancement, but additional scenarios, including modified star-formation efficiency, initial mass functions, or even exotic forms of energy could all change the story still further. Credit: R.P. Naidu et al., Open Journal of Astrophysics (submitted)/arXiv:2505.11263, 2025 It's worth pointing out that the reason for this galaxy's name, MoM-z14, is not because this is ""the mother of all galaxies"" that needs to be abbreviated as MoM, but rather because the discovery paper for this galaxy represents the first result from the ""Mirage or Miracle"" survey, which has been designed to spectroscopically test the abundance and nature of luminous galaxies (and luminous galaxy candidates) from the first ~500 million years of cosmic history. It's been confirmed that this galaxy is not a mirage; hence, by the survey team's definition, it's a (scientific) miracle. With this discovery - likely the first of many ultra-distant galaxies that will be revealed by this survey, as well as the larger-field COSMOS-Web survey - we can be confident that many of the early ""little red dot"" galaxies that are out there are going to show little evidence for large AGN contributions, and will instead be compact and dominated by a burst of recent star-formation. Galaxies GN-z11 and GLASS-z12 already display this as well, but with MoM-z14 having been revealed too, perhaps they aren't outliers after all. Finally, this galaxy, even at such an early time, is fairly massive: at about 100 million solar masses, or comparable to the Small Magellanic Cloud. Will this grow into a cosmic behemoth? Will it grow into a dwarf galaxy? Or does it represent one of the largest and most massive examples of an early globular cluster? With a strong agreement between all the different sources of data we have for this example, we can be confident that future observations, both of MoM-z14 as well as other galaxies sure to be found at similar, comparable distances, we're in a very favorable condition to better understand how our Universe grew up to become the fascinating way it is today."

NASA will provide additional information on the next undocking opportunity as available. NASA and its international partners will soon receive scientific research samples and hardware after a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft departs the International Space Station on Friday, May 23, for its return to Earth. Live coverage of undocking and departure begins at 11:45 a.m. EDT on NASA+. Learn how to watch NASA content through a variety of platforms, including social media. The Dragon spacecraft will undock from the zenith, or space-facing, port of the station's Harmony module at 12:05 p.m. and fire its thrusters to move a safe distance away from the station under command by SpaceX's Mission Control in Hawthorne, California. After re-entering Earth's atmosphere, the spacecraft will splash down at approximately 1:45 a.m. on Sunday, May 25, off the coast of California. NASA will post updates on the agency's space station blog. There is no livestream video of the splashdown. Filled with nearly 6,700 pounds of supplies, science investigations, equipment, and food, the spacecraft arrived at the space station on April 22 after launching April 21 on a Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for the agency's SpaceX 32nd commercial resupply services mission. Some of the scientific hardware and samples Dragon will return to Earth include MISSE-20 (Multipurpose International Space Station Experiment), which exposed various materials to space, including radiation shielding and detection materials, solar sails and reflective coatings, ceramic composites for reentry spacecraft studies, and resins for potential use in heat shields. Samples were retrieved on the exterior of the station and can improve knowledge of how these materials respond to ultraviolet radiation, atomic oxygen, charged particles, thermal cycling, and other factors. Additionally, Astrobee-REACCH (Responsive Engaging Arms for Captive Care and Handling) is returning to Earth after successfully demonstrating grasping and relocating capabilities on the space station. The REACCH demonstration used Astrobee robots to capture space objects of different geometries or surface materials using tentacle-like arms and adhesive pads. Testing a way to safely capture and relocate debris and other objects in orbit could help address end-of-life satellite servicing, orbit change maneuvers, and orbital debris removal. These capabilities maximize satellite lifespan and protect satellites and spacecraft in low Earth orbit that provide services to people on Earth. Books from the Story Time from Space project also will return. Crew members aboard the space station read five science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-related children's books in orbit and videotaped themselves completing science experiments. Video and data collected during the readings and demonstrations were downlinked to Earth and were posted in a video library with accompanying educational materials. Hardware and data from a one-year technology demonstration called OPTICA (Onboard Programmable Technology for Image Compression and Analysis) also will return to Earth. The OPTICA technology was designed to advance transmission of real-time, ultra-high-resolution hyperspectral imagery from space to Earth, and it provided valuable insights for data compression and processing that could reduce the bandwidth required for communication, lowering the cost of acquiring data from space-based imaging systems without reducing the volume of data. This technology also could improve services, such as disaster response, that rely on Earth observations. For more than 24 years, people have lived and worked continuously aboard the International Space Station, advancing scientific knowledge, and conducting critical research for the benefit of humanity and our home planet.

Source: Mount Sinai Hospital A mechanism involving potassium channels in the brain that control brain cell activity could provide a new and fundamentally different way of treating depression symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder, according to two complementary papers published recently by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. In two new research articles, published in Biological Psychiatry and Molecular Psychiatry, the researchers provide new insights into how a drug called ezogabine may impact the brain to improve depression. ""Depression is a devastating public health problem, and our understanding of what changes in the brain to cause the illness is still very limited,"" says James Murrough, MD, PhD, Director of the Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment at Mount Sinai and senior author of both studies. The results, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, showed an important role for KCNQ channel openers like ezogabine in normalizing hyperactivity of the VTA in people with both depression and anhedonia. Credit: Neuroscience News ""Our work represents a major step in unraveling the potential role of a specific protein complex in the brain-the KCNQ channel-and how targeting it could eventually offer a significant new modality for treating depression."" Ezogabine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 as an anticonvulsant medication for partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. Previous neuroscience research in mice, conducted by researchers at The Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai, suggested that increasing KCNQ channel activity could also represent a new approach to treating depression. Building on these findings, Dr. Murrough's research team became the first to test the hypothesis in humans with depression. That study, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 2021, revealed ezogabine was associated with significant improvements in depression symptoms and the ability to experience pleasure (anhedonia) in patients who were treated with the drug compared to patients who received placebo. The two new papers provide details from new analyses of the human brain imaging data collected from that initial clinical trial. The first of the two papers, published in Molecular Psychiatry, sheds light on the effects of ezogabine on a specific brain pathway. This study examined the impact of ezogabine on the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain, which is involved in the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motivation, pleasure, and reinforcement of behaviors. The results, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, showed an important role for KCNQ channel openers like ezogabine in normalizing hyperactivity of the VTA in people with both depression and anhedonia. ""Up to half of people with depression do not respond to first-line treatment, which may be due to the lack of interventions that directly affect the neurobiology underlying symptoms like anhedonia,"" says Laurel S. Morris, PhD, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine and first author of the paper. ""By specifically targeting VTA activity and connectivity, ezogabine could open the door to decidedly improved outcomes for people who struggle daily with depression and anhedonia."" In a second paper, published in Biological Psychiatry, research revealed that ezogabine was able to normalize connectivity between the brain's key reward regions and larger-scale brain networks including the posterior cingulate cortex, which plays a key role in internally directed thought and negative emotions. Patients who experienced greater improvement in their depression and anhedonia when treated with ezogabine showed decreased connectivity between brain reward regions and the cingulate cortex. Together, these two complementary studies suggest that KCNQ channel openers can potentially alleviate the specific known neurobiological changes that occur in animal models of depression as well as change the function of larger brain networks that might be uniquely used in humans to regulate thought processes such as rumination. ""These findings suggested to us that drugs targeting the KCNQ channel may trigger antidepressant effects by reducing interactions between the reward centers in the brain and those related to negative thinking and emotion,"" Dr. Murrough explains. ""This hypothesis will require confirmation in larger clinical trials.""

Molecular Psychiatry Closed access. ""Effects of the KCNQ (Kv7) Channel Opener Ezogabine on Resting-State Functional Connectivity of Striatal Brain Reward Regions, Depression, and Anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial"" by James Murrough et al. Biological Psychiatry Abstract Effects of KCNQ potassium channel modulation on ventral tegmental area activity and connectivity in individuals with depression and anhedonia Up to half of individuals with depression do not respond to first-line treatments, possibly due to a lack of treatment interventions informed by neurobiology. A novel therapeutic approach for depression has recently emerged from translational work targeting aberrant activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via modulation of the KCNQ voltage-gated potassium channels. In this study, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) with elevated anhedonia were randomized to five weeks of the KCNQ channel opener, ezogabine (up to 900 mg/day) or placebo. Participants completed functional MRI during a monetary anticipation task and resting-state at baseline and at end-of-treatment. The clinical results were reported previously. Here, we examined VTA activity during monetary anticipation and resting-state functional connectivity between the VTA and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and ventral striatum (mesolimbic pathway) at baseline and end-of-treatment. Results indicated a significant drug-by-time interaction in VTA activation during anticipation (F (1,34) = 4.36, p = 0.044), where VTA activation was reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo. Mesocortical functional connectivity was also higher in depressed participants at baseline compared to a healthy control group (t (56) = 2.68, p = 0.01) and associated with VTA hyper-activity during task-based functional MRI at baseline (R = 0.352, p = 0.033). Mesocortical connectivity was also reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo (significant drug-by-time interaction, F (1,33) = 4.317, p = 0.046). Together this translational work is consistent with preclinical findings highlighting VTA hyper-activity in depression, and suggesting a mechanism of action for KCNQ channel openers in normalizing this hyper-activity in individuals with both depression and anhedonia. Abstract Effects of the KCNQ (Kv7) Channel Opener Ezogabine on Resting-State Functional Connectivity of Striatal Brain Reward Regions, Depression, and Anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with available treatments often showing limited efficacy. Recent research suggests that targeting specific subtypes of depression and understanding the underlying brain mechanisms can improve treatment outcomes. This study investigates the potential of the potassium KCNQ (Kv7) channel opener ezogabine to modulate the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the brain's reward circuitry and alleviate depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, a core feature of MDD. Methods A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in individuals with MDD ages 18 to 65 years compared daily dosing with ezogabine (n= 19) with placebo (n = 21) for 5 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessed RSFC of the brain's key reward regions (ventral caudate, nucleus accumbens) at baseline and posttreatment. Clinical symptoms were measured using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and other clinical symptom scales. Results Ezogabine significantly reduced RSFC between the reward seeds and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus compared with placebo, which was associated with a reduction in depression severity. Improvements in anhedonia (SHAPS) and depressive symptoms (MADRS) with ezogabine compared with placebo were also associated with decreased connectivity between the reward seeds and mid/posterior cingulate regions (midcingulate cortex, PCC, precuneus). Conclusions The findings suggest that ezogabine's antidepressant effects are mediated through modulation of striatal-mid/posterior cingulate connectivity, indicating a potential therapeutic mechanism for KCNQ-targeted drugs for MDD and anhedonia. Future studies should validate these results in larger trials."

But in neurological disorders such as ALS and spinal muscular atrophy, or following spinal cord injuries, the mechanisms for moving life-essential RNA to injured sites within the cell fail. As a result, RNA molecules can't get to where they are needed and damage becomes permanent. Researchers at Stanford have developed a technology for transporting RNA to specific locations within a neuron, where it can repair and even regrow parts of the cell. Typically, CRISPR is used to slice and edit genetic code, but in this case the researchers didn't want to make any changes. Credit: Neuroscience News Their work, supported by the National Institutes of Health, forms the foundation for a new class of therapeutics that the researchers are calling ""spatial RNA medicine,"" which they hope will lead to treatments for neurological diseases as well as traumatic injuries. ""For the first time, we've harnessed the power of CRISPR technology to create a precise spatial zip code' that delivers RNA molecules exactly where they're needed within cells,"" said Stanley Qi, an associate professor of bioengineering and senior author on the paper published May 21 in Nature. ""Imagine being able to specifically target damaged sites within a neuron, repairing them, and promoting their regrowth - this is what our technology achieves."" A CRISPR-based mailman In recent years, researchers have realized that the distribution of RNA within a cell - where specific molecules are located - may be just as important as what they are capable of doing. An individual neuron can be over a meter long, and aging, injury, and mutations can all disrupt its ability to transport the tiny RNA over such a distance. ""Therapeutic RNA can't help if it doesn't get to where it's needed,"" Qi said. ""We wanted to create a technology that could reliably move RNA to where it needs to function."" Qi and his colleagues used a version of the gene-editing tool CRISPR, called CRISPR-Cas13, to target individual pieces of RNA (unlike the more widely known CRISPR-Cas9, which targets DNA). Typically, CRISPR is used to slice and edit genetic code, but in this case the researchers didn't want to make any changes. They simply wanted to move the existing RNA to a new place within the cell. ""Cas13 naturally acts like a pair of scissors, but we engineered it to act like a mailman instead,"" Qi said. ""Then we can tell it to carry the RNA from one precise location to another."" The researchers paired Cas13 with specific localization signals that act as addresses, instructing the Cas13 where to deliver the RNA. Each location within the cell has its own address molecule, so the researchers can direct the RNA to various locations by adding different molecules to the cell. Qi and his colleagues used their technology, which they are calling CRISPR-TO, to screen dozens of pieces of RNA and see if any of them would help neurons to grow. They added CRISPR-TO to mouse brain neurons in a petri dish, where it carried the RNA molecules to the tips of neurites - fingerlike protrusions that form synapses and connect to other neurons. They found several promising candidates, including one RNA molecule that increased neurite growth by as much as 50% over a 24-hour period. ""We are discovering more RNA targets that could promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration,"" said Mengting Han, a postdoctoral scholar in Qi's lab and lead author on the paper. ""We've added a new tool to the CRISPR toolbox, using it to control RNA localization inside the cell. This has never been achieved before and, importantly, it opens new therapeutic directions for treating neurodegenerative diseases."" Safer, more effective RNA medicine The researchers are using CRISPR-TO to screen additional RNA molecules to determine which ones will be most effective at repairing injured neurons in the brains of mice, as well as in human neurons. ""We are at the beginning of understanding how spatial organization of RNA benefits brain repair,"" Qi said. ""We hope our technology will help people figure out which RNAs will be the biggest players for better therapeutics."" Currently, the researchers are using CRISPR-TO to move endogenous RNAs - RNA molecules that are naturally produced within the cell. But it could also be used to provide precise control over RNA-based medicines, making them both safer and more efficient, Qi said. ""This potential excites us tremendously,"" Qi said. ""It's not enough for a molecule to just be in the cell. We need it to be in the right location at the right time. With our precise, programmable technology, you can target any RNA in any type of cell and bring it to the site of need in the body.""

""Clonal tracing with somatic epimutations reveals dynamics of blood ageing"" by Stanley Qi et al. Nature Abstract Clonal tracing with somatic epimutations reveals dynamics of blood ageing Current approaches used to track stem cell clones through differentiation require genetic engineering or rely on sparse somatic DNA variants, which limits their wide application. Here we discover that DNA methylation of a subset of CpG sites reflects cellular differentiation, whereas another subset undergoes stochastic epimutations and can serve as digital barcodes of clonal identity. We demonstrate that targeted single-cell profiling of DNA methylation at single-CpG resolution can accurately extract both layers of information. To that end, we develop EPI-Clone, a method for transgene-free lineage tracing at scale. Applied to mouse and human haematopoiesis, we capture hundreds of clonal differentiation trajectories across tens of individuals and 230,358 single cells. In mouse ageing, we demonstrate that myeloid bias and low output of old haematopoietic stem cells are restricted to a small number of expanded clones, whereas many functionally young-like clones persist in old age. In human ageing, clones with and without known driver mutations of clonal haematopoieis are part of a spectrum of age-related clonal expansions that display similar lineage biases. EPI-Clone enables accurate and transgene-free single-cell lineage tracing on hematopoietic cell state landscapes at scale."

Steve Dorsey - who has worked for the Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD) for 21 years, following in his father and grandfather's footsteps - learned of his diagnosis on Valentine's Day of this year, local ABC-affiliated station WMAR 2 News previously confirmed. While speaking to the New York Post, the 56-year-old, who is currently on medical leave while undergoing chemotherapy, revealed some of the symptoms he noticed before the diagnosis, which also confirmed the disease had spread to his lymph nodes and liver. The firefighter, who is part of BCFD's Engine 57 team in Curtis Bay, said everything had been fine health-wise until he started to have some trouble swallowing in January, per The Post. He told the outlet his issues were ""very benign"" at first, and sometimes he'd have to have a drink to help wash food down. Baltimore City Fire Department Engine 57. BCFD Engine 57/Facebook ""It progressively just started getting worse, where it was very difficult to eat anything, basically, without regurgitating it back up,"" Dorsey said, per the publication. Subsequent tests revealed masses in his lower esophagus, lymph nodes and liver, The Post noted. The outlet reported that Dorsey underwent routine check-ups every six months, and high blood pressure was his only concern before his diagnosis. Per the Mayo Clinic, ""Esophageal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the esophagus. The esophagus is a long, hollow tube that runs from the throat to the stomach. The esophagus helps move swallowed food from the back of the throat to the stomach to be digested."" ""Esophageal cancer makes up about 1 [percent] of all cancers diagnosed in the United States, but it is much more common in other parts of the world, such as Iran, northern China, India, and southern Africa,"" the American Cancer Society noted.

The love that I've gotten out of them has been amazing."" Baltimore City Fire Department Engine 57. BCFD Engine 57/Facebook The BCFD Engine 57 Facebook page has been promoting two local upcoming fundraisers to help raise money for Dorsey's treatment, as well as previously launching a GoFundMe page. Dorsey began chemotherapy in March and is expected to have treatment until June, The Post stated. ""I will have a follow-up CT scan done to see what the tumors look like,"" he said. ""We're hopeful that they've shrunk down, and if the chemotherapy and immunotherapies are successful in that, then we'll just keep moving forward with that."" He told the publication that his medical leave will eventually turn into medical retirement. ""I didn't expect it to happen this early or happen this way,"" he said, but insisted, ""It's been a great ride."" Dorsey's comments come after he told WMAR 2 News about his reaction to the diagnosis in March. ""You go through all those different stages of shock, disbelief, anger, and then you kind of accept it a little bit, but then you get angry again, so,"" he said. According to the Firefighter Cancer Support Network website, ""Firefighters have a 62 percent higher risk of getting esophageal cancer, and they have a 39 percent increased risk of dying from esophageal cancer,"" citing National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) research.

Have a question for Care and Feeding? Submit it here. Dear Care and Feeding, My mother grew up in a very Catholic family. So Catholic that my uncle joined the seminary right out of high school. He became a priest, but is able to make visits to see the family from time to time. We always have a big gathering where everyone gets together for Father's Day, and this year, he will be able to make it. The thing is, my ex-husband and I have gotten divorced since the last time we saw my uncle. My mom begged me not to say anything to him about it, and I foolishly agreed. Big mistake. Now my mom wants me and my ex to pretend to still be married when we both attend the family gathering on Father's Day, because she thinks it would crush my uncle to learn of our divorce. Is she asking too much, or should we just fake it for one afternoon? -An Unholy Request Dear Unholy Request, I too grew up in a Catholic family and seem to recall hearing a lot about how wrong it is to lie? Religion aside, your mother shouldn't be demanding that you do so. Her request is less about holiness and more about saving face. Which feels rather misguided, since it's not as though your uncle is unaware of the existence of divorce-and if by some chance he decides to take yours personally, that is definitely his problem, not yours. Neither you nor your ex should go along with your mother's ruse if you don't want to. Her demand does make me wonder if perhaps she is the one who hasn't fully adjusted to the fact of your divorce. There may not be much for you to do about that, even if it's true, and it's not as if you need any family member's approval to do what's right for you. I only point this out because if your mother isn't entirely okay with your situation, that has the potential to have a greater impact on your life than whatever your uncle-who you don't see very often-might think about it. If you think that might be the case, you can decide whether a more pointed conversation with your mom is warranted.

Dear Care and Feeding, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential-please include if you're open to Care and Feeding following up) Submit Dear Care and Feeding, My husband ""Grant"" has a 6-year-old daughter, ""Charity,"" from his previous marriage. The custody arrangement he has with his ex is such where she alternates spending 10-day stretches with her mother and with us. Charity is a very easygoing, fun kid to be around and we get along well. The problem is that Grant refuses to engage in any kind of sexual activity with me while his daughter is at our place. He claims that he is uncomfortable doing anything because he is afraid of the possibility she will hear it or walk in on us and report it to his ex, who is an extremely petty and vindictive person. Before the current custody agreement was hammered out, she frequently thwarted Grant's efforts to spend time with Charity, and my husband says he ""doesn't want to give her any potential ammo."" Charity's bedroom is all the way down the hall, so I very much doubt she will hear anything. I have suggested locking the door in case she tries to come in. Grant is against that because she sometimes has nightmares and will come running to jump in bed with us. I want very much for us to have children of our own, and at this rate I don't see how it will happen. What can I do to convince my husband how irrational his fears are? -Involuntary Part-Time Celibate Dear Part-Time Celibate, Advertisement Advertisement You have already presented Grant with a very simple, sensible solution-locking your bedroom door-and he still isn't willing. Could there be something else, apart from his daughter's presence, that has him feeling reluctant? Is he perhaps less certain than you are about having a child, or might there currently be a mismatch in your libidos? I'm not trying to make any assumptions, but whether it's merely the anxiety over his child or something else, your sex life is important and he should be willing to try to figure this out with you. Advertisement People manage to have sex despite young kids being in the house all the time. If Charity had a nightmare and needed you, it's not hard to yell ""just a second!"", throw some clothes on, and go unlock the door. I imagine you've also told Grant that you can be quieter on nights when she is staying with you. Even if his ex is looking for reasons to punish him, I doubt she's living under the illusion that you two don't sleep together. (Also, I am not a lawyer, but I don't think you can throw out a whole custody agreement because a child happens to do what many kids have done since time immemorial and walked in on their parents having sex. Which, again, does not have to happen, because as you have pointed out, you can just lock the door!) Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement If both you and Grant were fine with your 10-days-on, 10-days-off routine, that would be one thing-but you're not. So I think it's worth talking with him about this hang-up and why he's been so hesitant. Be as kind and patient as you can be, but be honest, too, and let him know that you aren't happy with the total lack of intimacy when Charity is in the house and would like it to change. You two might also consider talking with a competent sex therapist who can help you address whatever may be going on. Catch Up on Care and Feeding  Missed earlier columns this week? Read them here.  Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group! Dear Care and Feeding, My husband and I have a 7-year-old daughter, ""Annie,"" who has Tourette syndrome. Her tics include barking and random singing and hopping up and down. Advertisement Advertisement Recently, I learned while having a conversation with a family friend who had been there that my niece had been christened two weeks ago. She said she hoped that my family was feeling better, because my sister had told everyone we weren't present because we had the flu. When I called my sister and demanded an explanation, she said that while she loves us and doesn't mind spending individual time with Annie, she ""didn't want the distraction"" at her child's christening. I told her that we would spare her and the rest of the family the trouble, because we weren't going to bother with any future invitations. My parents and my brother have all been saying the same thing: They love Annie, but don't want events ""ruined"" or ""disrupted"" and that ""it can't be all about your daughter."" Advertisement My husband's mother, ""Susan,"" lives several states away. She has MS and is increasingly unable to care for herself. A few days ago, I learned that a position in my company has become available in the state where she lives. Susan adores Annie and they are very close (they FaceTime every few days). Annie does have friends here and a good but not great support system at school. My husband is a freelance writer, so a move would not be disruptive for his career. Given my MIL's growing need for help and the way my family continues to ostracize Annie, is requesting a transfer the right thing to do? -So Much for Family Sticking by You Dear So Much for Family, Advertisement I'm sorry your relatives have failed to include you and Annie in family celebrations. I have a disabled daughter, and my heart really hurt for you as I read your letter. I don't blame you at all for being angry. Advertisement Moving, uprooting your lives, changing schools, and assuming responsibility for your mother-in-law's care needs all represent major changes. You want to make the decision based on what is best for you and your husband and Annie. And whether you apply for a transfer or not, you'll still have choices to make regarding your family. I did wonder whether you were thinking about this move in part to avoid doing so-as if your family members could just be out of sight, out of mind-but wherever you live, you will still have to deal with your feelings over how they've treated your daughter, and you'll still have to decide whether or not to continue having a relationship with them. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement I'm not saying this to give your family any sort of benefit of the doubt, but it's unfortunately common for parents of disabled kids to have to do a fair bit of educating within their own families. It could be that further conversations with your family would help them better understand Annie, and how hurtful it is when they fail to include her. But I know that would be difficult labor on your part, and you might not be all that motivated to undertake it, especially when you don't know that they will ever come around. Whatever you wind up choosing where your relatives are concerned, I hope that you and Annie continue to find meaningful friendships and community-the kind of love and support you deserve, even if your family refuses to provide it. -Nicole More Advice From Slate Approximately a month ago I hired a young man from a pet store I frequent to housesit for a day.

9 Breakfast Foods That Could Be Making You Feel Sluggish by Noon - Yahoo,health,Your favorite morning foods could be making you more tired.,Vivian Chung,Real Simple,2025-05-22T10:34:00+00:00,"""Aim to eat within one to two hours of waking to support metabolism and energy levels throughout the day,"" says Jordan Hill, MCD, RD, CSSD, registered dietitian and certified specialist in sports dietetics.

""If you're someone who doesn't feel hungry upon waking, start with something small and build up to a full breakfast. Skipping meals in general can lead to low energy and overeating or cravings later in the day."" While protein helps keep you full and fuels your brain by slowing digestion, which prevents those blood sugar spikes and crashes, fiber slows the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream, and healthy fats provide a steady release of energy while keeping blood sugar from taking a nosedive. When combined in a balanced breakfast, this trio works together to keep your energy, focus, and mood steady from morning to night. While mornings can be hectic, what you eat (or don't eat) plays a huge role in your energy levels throughout the day. A balanced breakfast with a mix of protein, fiber, and healthy fats helps stabilize your blood sugar, meaning fewer crashes, better focus, and a mood that doesn't dip with your energy. Ahead, we're breaking down the morning foods that might be messing with your energy and what to try instead to keep you going strong all day . 01 of 09 Smoothies ""While smoothies are, in theory, a nutritious way to start the day, if you forget key nutrients, you may be feeling tired and hungry just a couple hours later,"" says Kaytee Hadley, MS, RDN, IFMCP, functional medicine dietitian and founder of Holistic Health and Wellness. ""I recommend including fruit, veggies, nuts or seeds, and a concentrated source of protein from a powder, tofu, or milk."" If you're someone who loves a fruit-only smoothie, she suggests enjoying it after a balanced meal rather than relying on it as a stand-alone breakfast. 02 of 09 Flavored Yogurt Though a convenient grab-and-go breakfast option, many flavored yogurts are sneakily packed with added sugar. In fact, Amy Davis, RDN, nutrition consultant at Live Conscious, notes that some varieties can contain up to 18 grams in just one serving. ""This surge of sugar first thing in the morning without much protein won't keep individuals full for long, and will likely lead to a dip in energy by mid-morning, plus cravings for more quick-absorbing, sugary carbs."" Instead, try plain Greek yogurt with berries, chia seeds, and a drizzle of nut butter. ""This Greek yogurt parfait is a perfectly balanced breakfast of protein from Greek yogurt, plus some probiotics for gut health, berries for antioxidants and fiber, chia seeds for more filling fiber, and nut butter for satiating healthy fats."" What Is the Healthiest Yogurt? RDs Share Their Top Picks 03 of 09 Coffee Creamer You might want to rethink that generous splash of creamer in your morning coffee, especially if it's the first thing hitting your stomach. ""Drinking concentrated amounts of sugar on an empty stomach, or without enough fiber or protein to balance it out, can lead to a sugar crash and zap your energy shortly after,"" says Hadley. And it's not just the sugar that can mess with your energy over time. ""While saturated fat doesn't have an immediate effect on blood sugar or energy, too much can lead to the development of insulin resistance and make it more difficult for your body to handle it in the future,"" she says. The good news is you don't have to give up your coffee routine. Just look for creamers that are lower in sugar and saturated fat. 04 of 09 Pancakes Pancakes might be a breakfast staple, but the typical stack is made with white refined flour and drenched in sugary syrup, racking up around 40 grams of added sugar with barely any fiber or protein. ""The large amount of sugar will trigger a quick rise in blood sugar, followed by the release of insulin, causing blood sugar to drop back down relatively quickly,"" says Davis. This mid-morning slump can leave you feeling sluggish, irritable, and reaching for another snack not long after. Instead, make the meal more balanced by enjoying one pancake alongside a couple of eggs and sliced tomatoes, or make a homemade version with smarter ingredients like rolled oats, eggs, collagen, mashed banana, and a splash of vanilla extract for more fiber, B vitamins, and protein content. 05 of 09 Instant Oatmeal Oatmeal on its own can fall short of the key nutrients needed to keep you full and energized. A typical packet of instant oats clocks in at around 33 grams of carbs and 12 grams of added sugar, but only offers about 4 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber. ""This breakfast will likely be quickly absorbed and digested, and lead to some short-term energy, but leave you feeling hungry just an hour or two later,"" says Davis. To level up your bowl, try adding functional boosters like a scoop of protein powder, fresh berries, chia seeds, and a drizzle of nut butter. These simple additions pack in protein, antioxidants, vitamin C, fiber, and healthy fats to help you stay full and fueled for hours. 06 of 09 White Bread Made from refined flour and stripped of key vitamins, minerals, and fiber that support better blood sugar control, white bread breaks down into sugar quickly once it hits your bloodstream. And without any protein, fiber, or fat to balance it out, you'll be reaching for another quick fix in no time. ""Ideally, most of the grain-based foods consumed should be whole grains,"" says Davis. For a more energizing alternative, she suggests swapping in a slice of sprouted whole grain bread and topping it with nut butter and berries or avocado and eggs. This simple switch loads your breakfast with protein, fat, and fiber, helping to slow digestion and give you a more sustained, steady energy boost. 07 of 09 Sugary Breakfast Cereals ""Sugary breakfast cereals tend to be low in both protein and fiber, two nutrients known to increase satiety and mitigate blood sugar spikes,"" says Hill. ""Without adequate protein or fiber in the meal, the sugary breakfast cereal may provide a burst of energy, but result in an energy crash later."" Though they may be tempting, Hill suggests treating sugary breakfast cereals like a treat rather than a meal option. The 7 Healthiest Cereals You Can Find at the Supermarket, According to Registered Dietitians 08 of 09 Pastries Typically packed with refined flours, sugar, and oils or butter high in saturated fat, pastries like croissants, donuts, and muffins can leave you dragging not long after eating them. ""Sugar and saturated fat can cause inflammation in the body, making one feel sluggish and tired,"" says Hill. And if they're a regular part of your morning routine, the saturated fat may start to impact your cholesterol levels over time. Instead, try whole grain toast topped with nut butter and fruit, a still-sweet option that Hill says offers fiber and natural sugars."
Common blood pressure drug shows promise for treating ADHD symptoms - PsyPost,health,"Amlodipine, typically used for hypertension, may have brain-based effects that make it a candidate for ADHD treatment, according to new research.",Eric W. Dolan,PsyPost,2025-05-22T10:15:43+00:00,"A new study published in <em><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02062-x"" target=""_blank"">Neuropsychopharmacology</a></em> provides preliminary evidence that amlodipine, a widely used medication for high blood pressure, may help manage symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity diso...","['adhd', 'amlodipine', 'drug', 'genetic', 'brain']",https://www.psypost.org/common-blood-pressure-drug-shows-promise-for-treating-adhd-symptoms/,"A new study published in <em><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02062-x"" target=""_blank"">Neuropsychopharmacology</a></em> provides preliminary evidence that amlodipine, a widely used medication for high blood pressure, may help manage symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In a series of experiments using animal models and human genetic data, researchers found that amlodipine reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity-key features of ADHD-while also demonstrating potential advantages over current stimulant medications. The findings suggest that this well-tolerated drug could serve as a foundation for a new type of non-stimulant treatment for the condition. ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental condition that typically emerges in childhood and can persist into adulthood. It is characterized by persistent symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily life, academic achievement, work performance, and social relationships. ADHD affects an estimated 2 to 5 percent of the global population and is associated with a higher risk of other mental health problems, including mood and anxiety disorders, substance use, and even suicide. Current treatments for ADHD typically involve stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. These drugs can be effective for many people, but they are also associated with several drawbacks. Side effects like insomnia, appetite loss, headaches, and increased blood pressure are common. There is also a potential for misuse, especially in adolescents and young adults. Importantly, about 25 percent of individuals with ADHD do not experience adequate symptom relief from any available medication. These limitations have driven researchers to explore new therapeutic options that are both effective and better tolerated. Researchers at 3Z Pharmaceuticals in Iceland sought to identify a non-stimulant medication that could offer an alternative for individuals who do not respond well to existing treatments. They focused on amlodipine, a widely used drug for treating high blood pressure, because it targets L-type calcium channels-proteins in the brain that help regulate electrical activity in neurons and are increasingly recognized as playing a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. The researchers hypothesized that modulating these calcium channels could help alleviate the symptoms of ADHD. Their goal was to determine whether amlodipine, which already has a strong safety record, could be repurposed as a novel treatment for the disorder. Their strategy was to integrate findings across multiple experimental systems-including behavioral testing in rats and zebrafish, pharmacological and brain imaging studies, and human genetic analyses. ""At 3Z, we developed a high-throughput behavioral screening platform for drug discovery, using genetically engineered zebrafish models,"" explained corresponding author Karl gir Karlsson, the CEO of 3Z and a professor of neuroscience at Reykjavik University. ""The platform is built to detect therapeutic effects across a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders with a behavioral phenotype. ADHD was a natural fit: it's highly prevalent, current medications have significant limitations - including adverse effects and a large non-responder group - and there's a clear need for novel therapeutics."" ""Crucially, we also engineered a robust zebrafish model of ADHD that exhibits core behavioral symptoms like hyperactivity and impulsivity. These symptoms are reversed by existing ADHD medications, giving us a solid positive control and validating the model's predictive power. With this in place, we were positioned to conduct an unbiased drug repurposing screen to identify compounds with improved efficacy or safety profiles."" In the first part of the study, researchers tested five drug candidates in rats bred to exhibit ADHD-like hyperactivity. Among the options, only amlodipine consistently reduced hyperactive behaviors, particularly in female rats. These effects were observed after 30 days of treatment and were confirmed through objective measures such as distance traveled and time spent moving. Other compounds tested did not show significant effects. To extend their findings to another species, Karlsson and his colleagues examined how amlodipine affected behavior in zebrafish with a genetic mutation linked to impulsivity and hyperactivity. Zebrafish are a useful model for studying brain function, as they share a large proportion of their genes with humans. In this experiment, the researchers used a behavioral task designed to measure impulsive actions. They found that amlodipine significantly reduced premature responses in the zebrafish, indicating improved impulse control. The results were comparable to those produced by methylphenidate. The researchers then explored whether amlodipine could enter the brain and influence neural activity. They confirmed that the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier in both zebrafish and rats. In zebrafish, exposure to amlodipine reduced activation of a brain region involved in regulating attention and behavior, as indicated by a drop in the expression of a protein called c-Fos. These results suggest that the behavioral effects of amlodipine are likely due to its direct action on the brain, not just its effects on blood pressure. ""The magnitude and consistency of amlodipine's behavioral effects in our ADHD model were unexpected, given the widespread assumption that the drug does not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB),"" Karlsson told PsyPost. ""This posed a challenge in interpreting our data: the effects were too robust to plausibly arise from peripheral mechanisms alone."" ""Applying Occam's Razor, the most straightforward explanation was that amlodipine does in fact reach the brain. We confirmed this directly using unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficient assays across multiple species, including zebrafish, mice, and rats. These assays demonstrated that amlodipine does cross the BBB, at levels consistent with central nervous system (CNS) activity."" To understand how these findings might apply to humans, the researchers conducted genetic analyses using large datasets. One analysis used a technique called Mendelian randomization to explore whether genetic variations that affect calcium channels are linked to ADHD. The results showed a significant association between ADHD and several subunits of L-type calcium channels-the same ones targeted by amlodipine. This supports the idea that these channels may play a role in ADHD symptoms and could be a meaningful treatment target. A second genetic analysis looked at data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health database with genetic and health information from over 500,000 participants. Individuals with a higher genetic risk for ADHD were more likely to report mood swings and risk-taking behavior. However, among those taking amlodipine, these tendencies were less common, suggesting that the drug may help manage some core features of ADHD even outside of a clinical diagnosis. ""We identified amlodipine, a commonly prescribed calcium channel blocker for hypertension, as a candidate for repurposing in ADHD,"" Karlsson said. ""Our findings suggest that it targets a previously underappreciated mechanism in the brain relevant to attention and impulse control. This is significant because it shows how existing medications, already well-characterized in terms of safety and pharmacology, can be redirected to address unmet needs in psychiatric disorders - potentially reducing the time and cost of drug development."" The researchers emphasize that while these findings are promising, amlodipine is not yet approved for ADHD treatment and further testing in clinical trials is necessary. Still, the drug's long-standing safety record and widespread availability make it an appealing candidate for repurposing. Amlodipine is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is inexpensive, and has a low risk of drug interactions. One strength of the study was its multi-pronged approach, which combined laboratory experiments with large-scale human genetic data. By showing consistent effects across species and methods, the researchers were able to build a compelling case for further investigation. The study also introduced a new way of using genetic tools to assess drug effects across multiple biological targets, an approach that could help accelerate drug discovery for other brain disorders. However, the research is not without limitations. The animal studies, while informative, do not fully capture the complexity of human ADHD, which involves a wide range of behavioral and cognitive symptoms. Additionally, the genetic analyses relied on self-reported symptoms and indirect measures of ADHD traits rather than formal diagnoses. Future clinical studies will be needed to determine whether the benefits of amlodipine extend to diagnosed individuals and how the drug compares to existing treatments in real-world settings. ""While amlodipine shows promise in preclinical models, it is not currently suitable for use in ADHD in its marketed form,"" Karlsson noted. ""Further optimization through chemical modification is necessary to enhance CNS selectivity and ensure a favorable therapeutic index in the context of ADHD."" The researchers are now preparing to launch a Phase II clinical trial to formally evaluate the safety and effectiveness of amlodipine for ADHD in humans. If successful, this effort could pave the way for a new class of non-stimulant treatments, offering hope to individuals who do not respond to or cannot tolerate current medications. ""While the spotlight is on amlodipine and ADHD, this work also represents a proof-of-concept for a broader drug repurposing pipeline for CNS disorders,"" Karlsson said. ""Our approach combines unbiased screening in disease-relevant zebrafish models with human genetic validation to prioritize and de-risk candidates before clinical development. This dual strategy can accelerate the discovery of novel CNS therapeutics by leveraging known molecules in new ways - a particularly attractive proposition in an area where traditional drug development has often struggled.""

This surge is due to alackof oral hygiene. Yes, poor oral hygiene has consequences that are far beyond cavities and toothaches. Poor oral health is a red flag for more serious and sometimes life-threatening health problems, even linked with heart health.A root canal, also known as endodontic therapy, is a dental procedure used to treat infection or damage inside a tooth. This treatment is often needed when the pulp, the soft tissue inside the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels, becomes inflamed or infected due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures, or a crack or chip in the tooth. The requirement for this treatment often stems from poor oral health. If not treated, poor oral health, especially gum disease, can lead to serious medical conditions that can impact quality of life and longevity. From heart disease to cognitive decline, here are five serious health conditions commonly linked to poor oral health.Poor oral health, especially periodontal disease, has been associated with cardiovascular issues. The bacteria from inflamed gums can enter the bloodstream, contributing to plaque buildup in arteries. This process, known as atherosclerosis, increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A 2025studypresented at the American Stroke Association International Stroke Conference 2025, found that people who regularly floss their teeth (one or more times per week) may lower their risk of stroke caused by a blood clot, which travels from the heart and a stroke associated with an irregular heartbeat such as atrial fibrillation (AFib).Ignoring your oral health can even lead to complications during pregnancy. A recent study conducted by the Oral Health Workforce Research Center at the University at Albany found that maintaining good oral health during pregnancy is associated with reduced incidence of gestational diabetes and hypertension. ""Our findings reinforce the connection between oral health and overall health. Integrating oral health education and services into maternal health care and expanding the oral health workforce through training, better distribution, and interprofessional collaboration with prenatal care providers can improve access to oral health services for pregnant women, especially in underserved populations, and help reduce the risks of gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders,"" the researchers said. The relationship between diabetes and oral health is a two-way street. Poor oral hygiene can worsen the life quality of diabetes patients. It makes it harder to control blood sugar levels, and diabetes increases susceptibility to gum disease. Studies suggest that people with diabetes are twice as likely to develop periodontitis due to impaired immune responses. Your oral health is even linked to kidney function. A 2024studysuggests that chronic kidney disease may also be linked with tooth loss. The study found that low tooth count is linked with systemic diseases such as diabetes, thyroid disease, and osteoporosis, plus an increased risk of stroke. ""This study highlights the known link between chronic kidney disease and bone metabolism. Increased attention to oral and bone health is warranted in postmenopausal women with chronic kidney disease, in addition to meticulous efforts aimed at preserving kidney function. Conversely, oral health is a window to overall health, and good oral hygiene is important for women of all ages,"" the researchers said. The twice-yearly trip to the dentist could do more than keep teeth and gums healthy. It may decrease the risk of pneumonia by reducing bacteria in the mouth, according to a 2016 study. ""There is a well-documented connection between oral health and pneumonia, and dental visits are important in maintaining good oral health. We can never rid the mouth of bacteria altogether, but good oral hygiene can limit the quantities of bacteria present,"" the researchers said. They also stressed that oral health is linked to overall health.Ensure to brush your teeth twice a day. Flossing is good. Also, schedule an appointment twice a year with your dentist."

Most people will be exposed to HSV-1 in their lives and lots of people get cold sores, so this conclusion might sound alarming, but it's important to understand what the paper is actually saying - and what it isn't. What was the study about and what did it show? The newly published paper comes from an international team of researchers working at Gilead Sciences Inc., a US pharmaceutical company developing drugs for a number of different diseases, including HSV-1. The study had a retrospective case-control design. Patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD) were matched with a control participant of the same age and sex, living in the same region, and with a similar health history except for one key difference: the controls had no history of neurological disorders. In total, 344,628 pairs were included. Of the people with Alzheimer's or ADRD, it was found that 0.44 percent of them had been diagnosed with HSV-1. In the control group, it was 0.25 percent. These are both tiny fractions of the overall number of people, but the difference between these two figures was found to be significant. After adjusting for other health conditions that could play a role, the team concluded that those with Alzheimer's disease/ADRD were 80 percent more likely to have been diagnosed with HSV-1. Another finding was that those who had used an antiviral medication to treat their HSV-1 seemed to be somewhat protected and were 17 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's. While the topline findings focused on HSV-1, the team also looked at two similar viruses: HSV-2, the more common cause of genital herpes; and varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus responsible for chickenpox and shingles. Both of these were also associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. What can be concluded from this study? This kind of study can only show that two factors are linked in some way; it cannot show that one causes the other. There are also limitations to the study - as with every research project - that must be accounted for. ""Despite the large sample size, this research has limitations partly due to only using health records and administrative claims data,"" said Dr Sheona Scales, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, in a statement to the Science Media Centre. ""Most people infected with HSV-1 don't have any symptoms so some infections might not have been recorded. Infections predating the information recorded are also not available."" Other scientists have been more critical. Dr David Vickers, of the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary, commented, ""This pharma-funded research exaggerates the role of HSV-1, failing to appreciate its absence in 99.56 percent of [Alzheimer's disease] cases."" ""The study's data source makes its findings ungeneralisable, and it overstates a minor infection as a public health priority' to justify unnecessary treatment."" However, a number of others, including Professor Tara Spires-Jones of the University of Edinburgh and Professor Cornelia van Duijn of the University of Oxford, praised the study for its careful methodological design, whilst acknowledging that this can't be the end of the story. ""More research is needed to understand the best way to protect our brains from Alzheimer's disease as we age,"" said Spires-Jones, adding that ""it is important to note that HSV-1 infection, which is extremely common in the population, is by no means a guarantee that someone will develop Alzheimer's."" HSV-1 and Alzheimer's: What evidence do we already have? The study is part of a much broader conversation and a growing body of evidence suggesting that HSV-1 and similar viruses can have a direct impact on the brain, which may include Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. A 2024 paper in the Journal of Virology used a mouse model to show that HSV-1 can enter the brain via both the brainstem and olfactory nerve, triggering an inflammatory response that can persist when the virus is no longer detectable. Earlier this year, a team at the University of Illinois Chicago led a study that found HSV-1 particles can be shed in tears and can reach the nasal cavity that way, moving directly into the brain and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. A 2021 paper in the journal Vaccines even went as far as to argue that the evidence for a ""major role"" for HSV-1 in Alzheimer's disease was ""overwhelming"". ""We're not saying viruses explain everything. But they may be central to it. This is no longer a fringe theory - it's the next phase of Alzheimer's research, and we're pursuing it,"" said Dr Bryce Vissel, Director of the Centre for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, in a comment to the Australian Science Media Centre. Vissel's research group are also actively conducting studies in this area. Even though most of the experts agree that more research is needed to better understand what's going on, some have pointed to the fact that this study seems to suggest that treating HSV-1 with antiviral medications could help combat the potential damage to the brain. They say doing more to treat and detect these infections, even while the research continues, may not be a bad thing. ""With many GPs and the population being unaware of the dementia related benefits of treating HSV infections and preventing VZV activation through vaccination, it is time to call for actions informing those working in primary care as well as the population at large,"" said van Duijn. Unless you were vaccinated, chances are you were exposed to VZV as a kid; there are now vaccines available that prevent the virus reactivating later in life as shingles, and you can ask a healthcare professional about availability where you are. As for HSV-1 and 2, many people may be infected without ever having any symptoms. ""If you are worried about a cold sore or your general health, be sure to seek the appropriate help from a health professional,"" recommends Dr Richard Oakley, Director of Research and Innovation at Alzheimer's Society. The new study is published in the journal BMJ Open."
Forget Keto: This Fiber-Fueled Gut Trick Helped Mice Melt Fat Fast - SciTechDaily,health,A gut-powered acetate trick slashes fat by flipping metabolism—no muscle loss required.,Charles G.

When combined with specific Bacteroides bacteria, acetate rewires metabolism, boosting fat burning and reducing sugar availability. This mechanism mimics fasting or a keto diet and could pave the way for new functional foods to fight obesity in humans. Acetate and Gut Bacteria: A Surprising Duo Against Obesity A team of researchers in Japan, led by Hiroshi Ohno at the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, has uncovered an exciting new approach to reducing obesity. Their study shows that giving the gut extra acetate, a natural compound, can lower both fat and liver mass in mice. But there's a catch: this effect only works when specific gut bacteria called Bacteroides are also present. When these bacteria and acetate work together, they help the body burn more fat and remove excess sugars from the gut. The findings were recently published in Cell Metabolism. Obesity is a major global health issue, affecting hundreds of millions of people. It is often linked to high intake of sugar and starchy foods and increases the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Interestingly, eating fiber has been shown to reduce the risk of these very same diseases. Although humans cannot digest fiber, it reaches the large intestine where it is fermented by gut bacteria. This fermentation produces byproducts, some of which enter the bloodstream and help regulate metabolism. AceCel: A Smart Acetate Delivery System The most common of these byproducts is acetate, which is known to have some beneficial effects on host metabolism. Although this makes dietary fiber a good ""prebiotic,"" individual variation in the production of acetate and other useful byproducts limits its efficacy. To get around this problem, Ohno and his team previously developed a kind of acetate supplement by combining it with cellulose. AceCel ensures acetate reaches the distal large intestine, where it can work its magic. Weight Loss Without Muscle Loss In the new study, the team investigated how AceCel affects mouse metabolism and the composition of gut bacteria. They found that when given AceCel, both normal and obese mice lost weight without losing muscle mass. This was not true for other short-chain fatty-acid byproducts, meaning that acetate itself is the key. Further tests were designed to figure out how this was happening. They next discovered that compared with mice on a normal diet, when AceCel-fed mice were resting, they generated more energy from burning liver fat and less from burning carbohydrates. This is similar to what happens when fasting or on a low-carb, keto diet, and promotes weight loss. Hypothesizing that the effects on the gut microbiome would also be similar, they analyzed the gut microbiota, finding that eating AceCel led mice to have more Bacteroides bacteria in their guts. The Key: Acetate Plus Bacteroides Bacteria They then tested AceCel in mice that had controlled gut microbiota: either no bacteria at all, or one of several Bacteroides species. They found that AceCel had no effect on body, liver, or fat mass in the gut-bacteria free mice, while three Bacteroides species had similar positive effects on each. This means that the specific combination of acetate and Bacteroides bacteria in the intestines is necessary for the observed weight loss to occur. Sugar Reduction, Fat Burning, and Obesity Prevention Digging deeper, they found that this combination leads to more fermentation of carbohydrates in the gut, meaning that there is less sugar available for the host to process. By eliminating the sugars, fat-derived energy is promoted, and less sugar is stored as glycogen in the liver, thus explaining how obesity is reduced. ""Developing a treatment or prevention strategy for obesity is an urgent issue that must be solved quickly,"" says Ohno. ""We found that acetylated cellulose can prevent obesity by modulating the function of the gut microbiome."" ""Our next step is to confirm the safety and efficacy of using acetylated cellulose to treat obesity in humans. If so, it could become an important ingredient in functional foods that prevent obesity.""

For instance, when you're around someone you love, you will behave very differently than you would around someone you dislike. Likewise, your energy will affect the space around you differently, telling each person you are with someone you love. Healthline writer Crystal Raypole noted , ""It may not seem like it, but being in love is a somewhat scientific process. Falling in love involves a lot of hormones, which can supercharge your feelings and make them wildly fluctuate. When you're around the person you love, increases in dopamine and norepinephrine lead to feelings of pleasure, giddiness, nervous excitement, and euphoria."" Because of this, a woman's energy will change when she's around the person she loves the most. Here are 11 beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most: 1. She undergoes physical changes One of the first ways that a woman's energy will change when she's around the person she loves most is through a change in her physical energy. Things that should be inexplicable, like a faster heartbeat, increased sweating, or shakiness, can be linked to chemical changes in the body. When you're around the person you love, you don't stay the same, quite literally. Assistant professor of human ecology at the University of Texas, Timothy Loving, explained , ""Part of the whole attraction process is strongly linked to physiological arousal as a whole. Typically, that's going to start with things like increased heart rate, sweatiness, and so on."" Cardiac electrophysiologist Dr. Reginald Ho added that a rush of adrenaline makes someone's heart beat faster when they see the person they love. Hormonal changes occur in a woman's body when she sees the person she loves the most. These can have a huge impact on her energy and change it in a beautiful way. A woman around the person she loves most will naturally act differently because she has no other choice. RELATED: 11 Innocent Habits That Destroy A Woman's Feminine Energy 2. She feels nervous Another way a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most is that she'll get a bit nervous. The exact level of anxious energy she feels can differ depending on the person, but there's a good chance she'll feel some nerves around the person she loves. While some mistake this nervous energy for a general feeling of anxiety, it's likely that she feels this way because of the person she loves. VeryWell Mind writer Sian Ferguson explained that we all engage in nervous habits, but sometimes they can be a sign of something more. ""Nervous habits are those little behaviors people tend to do without even realizing it - like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or shifting in their seat. They're just our natural reactions to feeling uncomfortable or excited."" Hannah Owens, LMSW, said that exhibiting these habits around the person you love is normal. ""Feeling a romantic interest in somebody can be anxiety-inducing - you don't know if they reciprocate the feelings, and you're focused on making a good first impression, which can be nerve-wracking,"" she said. In other words, a woman bringing some nervous energy to the room when she loves someone is normal and can indicate just how interested she is. RELATED: 11 Beautiful Traits Of People Who Radiate Good Energy 3. She is connected to her partner's emotions A woman in tune with her partner will be connected to their emotions. In fact, she may even absorb those emotions. A woman in love will naturally want to be as close to her partner as possible, even to the point of feeling their same emotions and understanding exactly how they feel. Marriage and family therapist Amanda Turecek shared that this can be particularly prevalent for highly sensitive people (HSP). ""Research seems to indicate that certain neurons - mirror neurons - act differently in the brains of HSP than in the brains of non-HSP,"" she said. ""Mirror neurons kick in to gear in our prefrontal cortex, our area of the brain that also controls things like morality and planning around consequences. They encourage us to imitate others and are more active in the brains of HSPs."" In other words, highly sensitive people are more likely to imitate those around them. If a woman is an HSP, she may be more likely to absorb emotions from those around her, especially the person she loves most, as that is likely also who she admires the most. This leads to a deep connection and understanding of feelings. RELATED: 11 Phrases Brilliant People Use To Soften Their Energy To Get What They Want 4. She becomes more nurturing A woman around the person she loves most may become more nurturing. Scientists have often debated whether women are more nurturing and compassionate than men, something Emma Seppala discussed in UC Berkeley's Greater Good Magazine . Seppala noted that women are often measured to have more oxytocin. ""Women may at times have higher levels of oxytocin - sometimes called the cuddle hormone' or love hormone' because it is linked to bonding, social connection and monogamy,"" she said. ""It is produced in women during labor and lactation in women and is believed to trigger bonding and nurturing behaviors."" Whether women are more compassionate than men is still debatable, but based on explanations like these, women have plenty of reasons to be nurturing. Even setting levels of oxytocin aside, many women are nurturing around those they love. Being around the one they love most would surely bring out this reaction. RELATED: 15 Early Clues Someone's Energy Is Pure Poison, According To Psychology 5. She changes to become more like her partner Changing to become more like your partner isn't necessarily advisable, as everyone should strive to maintain their own autonomy and be their own person. That being said, many women who are in love will make what are sometimes subtle, difficult-to-notice changes to become more like their partners. Marty Nemko, PhD, noted that becoming more like your partner is completely normal over time. In fact, it would probably be strange not to. He advocates taking inventory of oneself so you can determine whether or not those changes are things you feel like celebrating. Over time, a woman's energy will likely subtly shift to become closer to that of the person she loves the most. Because she spends so much time around that person and is so interested in them, she will naturally lean into their energy and adapt it for her own purposes. Sometimes these changes will be noticeable, and sometimes they'll be so small you can't pick them up without paying close attention. RELATED: 11 Types Of People That Are Not Worth Your Time Or Energy, According To Research 6. She is more focused on her partner's wants and needs When a woman loves her partner, she is more in tune with them and what makes them happy. Based on their wants and needs, she will do the things she knows will keep them satisfied. Her energy will change because she will be focused almost solely on her partner, drowning out the noise of the world and keeping her attention where she feels it is most important. Susan Krauss Whitbourne, PhD, ABPP, cited a study from Florida State University, which found that ""mindfulness in relationships is a key component of being able to take the perspective of your partner. This, in turn, makes partners more compassionate."" When a woman is focused on her partner, she is more likely to be mindful of them and compassionate towards them. Putting what they want and need before what she wants and needs herself shifts her energy so that it is beautifully centered on her partner. RELATED: 7 Harsh Signs Someone Has Main Character Energy And You're Just An Extra, According To Research 7. She needs to be closer to her partner If a woman is around the person she loves most, she will want to be physically closer to them, making them emotionally closer as well. Doing things like holding hands, hugging, and touching will bring two people closer together. Her energy will change as she feels closer to her partner, and she will feel loved and cherished. An article published in Social and Personality Psychology Compass noted that relationships affect one's health for good and bad. ""Positive aspects of close relationships, such as intimacy and social support, predict better health outcomes, including longer survival following a breast cancer diagnosis, and improved emotional well-being,"" researchers noted. If a woman feels close to her partner, it will lead to better health outcomes for both. This will give a woman a brighter, lighter energy. As her physical energy changes, so will her emotional and spiritual energy. She will become a light for those around her. RELATED: 10 Subtle Ways A Weak Man Drains A Powerful Woman's Energy Without Her Realizing 8. She and her partner have an unspoken communication A woman around the person she loves most can tell what they're thinking without speaking. They will have a form of unspoken communication, like a secret language. For them, it just takes a look to know what the other person is thinking. Words are not required. The University of Texas Permian Basin said , ""Nonverbal communication can make or break a relationship. A single glance can spark an argument, while a simple touch on the shoulder can mend wounded pride. And sometimes, the sting of words is easier to bear than the weight of crushing silence. There's power in what goes unspoken."" A woman who can communicate with her partner without words will have a different energy around her. She feels more assured both in who she is and in her relationship. This confidence can be powerful and radiates to everyone around her. RELATED: 11 Ways To Increase Your Aura And Make People Instantly Attracted To Your Energy 9. She feels more secure If a woman is in a relationship where she feels safe and secure physically, she's likely also to feel that way emotionally. Her energy will shift to quiet confidence and competence because she knows she is taken care of and space is being held for her. This will, in turn, give her the freedom to be who she really is. PsychCentral writer Sonya Matejko stated , ""Emotional safety is the foundation for a loving and healthy relationship. It's about establishing trust with another person and feeling safe enough to be open and vulnerable with them. To put it simply, emotional safety is feeling secure enough to truly express yourself with someone and show up as your most authentic self."" When a woman is around the person she loves most, she will feel physically and emotionally safe. This sense of security will transform her energy into something more confident and ready for anything. Her energy will be stronger, and so will she. RELATED: 7 Stoic Techniques To Read People's Energy Easily 10. She feels more open and vulnerable A woman who is around the person she loves most will be able to tap into her inner vulnerability instead of putting up walls. She won't be afraid to share how she's feeling or unpack her baggage because she knows her partner has her back completely. Her energy shifts in a way that makes her more confident and open to sharing. Marriage and family therapist Shari Foos noted , ""Vulnerability is when a person willingly takes the risk to reveal their emotions and weaknesses. This emotional openness is essential in all healthy relationships, as it paves the way for deeper understanding and evokes the empathy necessary for healthy long-term relationships."" If a woman feels she can be vulnerable with the person she loves the most, that vulnerable energy will transfer to her everyday life. She'll become naturally more open and willing to help others feel safe in doing so as well. RELATED: 6 Signs Someone Is An Energy Vampire Who Will Only Drain You 11. She is excited When a woman is around the person she loves the most, everything will feel more exciting to her. Her future will appear more exciting with her partner in the picture, and she will feel better about herself. This excitement will translate into her energy as she lights up the room and the world around her. This can feel similar to what some call ""new relationship energy."" Psychotherapist Kristin Papa, LCSW, said , ""New relationship energy usually refers to the intense excitement, euphoria, and almost electrical sensation typically experienced at the beginning of a romantic relationship."" New relationship energy causes excitement that shows in a woman's energy. The great thing is Papa confirmed this feeling can last well after the ""honeymoon phase"" is over.

Cognitive training may reduce negative self-perceptions in people with depression and PTSD - PsyPost,health,Underestimating one’s own cognitive abilities is common in depression and PTSD.

A new study published in <em><a href=""https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2025-18950-001"" target=""_blank"">Neuropsychology</a></em> provides evidence that this negative self-perception, known as metacognitive bias, is both common and severe in individuals with high levels of depressive and PTSD symptoms. The researchers also found that targeted or game-based cognitive training can improve these biases and may contribute to a reduction in symptom severity. Depression and PTSD are two of the most common mental health conditions, often marked by persistent negative thoughts and emotional distress. Depression is characterized by symptoms such as sadness, low energy, and loss of interest in daily activities, while PTSD can involve intrusive memories, avoidance of reminders, emotional numbness, and heightened arousal following exposure to traumatic events. Both conditions are known to distort how individuals perceive themselves and the world around them. In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in how metacognition-the ability to reflect on and evaluate one's own thoughts and abilities-may influence mental health. One important aspect of metacognition is ""metacognitive bias,"" or the tendency to systematically overestimate or underestimate one's own abilities. While people in the general population often show a slight tendency to overestimate themselves, this study focused on the opposite problem: large-scale underestimation among individuals with depression and PTSD. The researchers wanted to examine how strongly these negative self-perceptions were related to symptoms and whether cognitive training could help reduce them. To explore these questions, researchers reanalyzed data from a randomized controlled trial known as the BRAVE study, which involved 84 participants, mostly military veterans, who had experienced mild traumatic brain injuries and reported cognitive difficulties. About three-quarters of the participants had either elevated depression, PTSD symptoms, or both. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two 13-week training programs: a ""targeted cognitive training"" group that completed computerized exercises designed to improve attention, memory, and executive function, or an ""entertainment training"" group that played puzzle and board games like Tetris and Solitaire. Before and after the training, participants completed a variety of assessments. Self-reported cognitive performance was measured using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, a validated 25-item scale that captures daily lapses in attention and memory. Objective cognitive performance was evaluated using a battery of tests measuring learning, memory, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. By comparing self-perceived and actual performance, researchers calculated each participant's metacognitive bias. Depression and PTSD symptoms were also measured using well-established clinical questionnaires. At the start of the study, the researchers found that people with elevated depression or PTSD symptoms significantly underestimated their cognitive abilities compared to their actual test scores. On average, participants with both conditions scored nearly 2.3 standard deviations below the norm in their self-assessments, despite relatively mild objective impairments. This discrepancy-referred to as a negative global metacognitive bias-was strongly linked to the severity of depression and PTSD symptoms. The researchers found no evidence that these negative biases were linked to specific types of cognitive impairment, suggesting that they reflect a broader pattern of self-doubt rather than performance in a particular area. Over the 13-week intervention period, participants in both the targeted and entertainment training groups showed notable improvements. Those who completed either program reported fewer cognitive problems, reduced depression symptoms, and improved metacognitive accuracy. Importantly, the size of the improvement in metacognitive bias was correlated with the reduction in both depression and PTSD symptoms. This relationship was especially strong in the entertainment training group, where participants who most improved their self-perception also experienced the greatest mental health benefits. Interestingly, while both training programs improved self-reported cognition and metacognitive bias, only the targeted training group showed small, non-significant trends toward better objective cognitive performance. This suggests that the subjective feeling of improved cognitive ability-rather than actual test performance-may play a more important role in symptom improvement for people with depression and PTSD. The researchers believe the performance feedback embedded in both training programs may be key to these improvements. In both training conditions, participants received feedback on their progress and were rewarded for correct performance, helping them to form more accurate beliefs about their cognitive abilities. This positive reinforcement may have helped counteract the negative thinking patterns common in depression and PTSD. Three months after training ended, participants continued to report lower depression symptoms, and those in the entertainment group also maintained improvements in PTSD symptoms and metacognitive bias. These lasting effects suggest that cognitive training-especially when designed to be engaging and motivating-may have durable benefits for people struggling with self-doubt and negative thinking. While the study offers promising evidence, the authors note several limitations. The sample consisted primarily of military veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other groups. Additionally, the study did not include a no-treatment control group, making it difficult to rule out the influence of nonspecific effects such as time, attention, or participant expectations. Future studies with larger, more diverse samples and more rigorous control conditions will be needed to confirm whether improvements in metacognitive bias can directly lead to reductions in depression and PTSD symptoms.

DOH has concluded there was no further community spread from those two cases. Health officials are concerned, however, of the growing number of cases on the mainland, which has now surpassed 1,000 across 30 states this year. ""DOH recommends continued vigilance and efforts to increase the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination rate,"" said the department. ""High vaccination rates protect individuals and communities and prevent cases from becoming outbreaks."" Vaccination rates for all routinely recommended vaccinations for school entry, including those for measles, pertussis, polio and chickenpox, have declined in Hawaii and nationally since 2019.

High-quality carbs include those from whole grains, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables and legumes. Those carbs were associated with better physical function and cognitive health decades later. What you eat in your 40s and 50s might help determine how well you age decades later. According to a new study published in JAMA Network Open, women who consumed more high-quality carbohydrates and fiber in midlife were significantly more likely to reach older adulthood with good physical and cognitive function-and without major chronic illnesses. The study supports what nutrition experts have long suspected: it's not just about how many carbohydrates you eat, but which ones you choose. Carbs from whole plant foods , like fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains, were linked to a higher likelihood of healthy aging. Meanwhile, diets high in refined carbohydrates (think: cookies, white-flour pasta) had the opposite effect. If you're looking for simple, sustainable ways to support your future health, this research makes a strong case for upgrading the quality of your carbs. How Was This Study Conducted? Researchers from Tufts University and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted a prospective cohort study-a study that follows a group of people over time-using data from the well-known Nurses' Health Study. This long-running study has followed more than 100,000 female nurses since 1976, collecting detailed information about their diets, lifestyles and health. For this analysis, the researchers focused on more than 47,000 women who were under the age of 60 in 1984. Participants completed comprehensive food frequency questionnaires in 1984 and 1986, and researchers tracked their diets and health outcomes over the next 30-plus years. By 2016, the women were between ages 70 and 93. Just under 8% of the women qualified as healthy agers. To define ""healthy aging,"" the researchers looked for women who met all of the following criteria: They were free from 11 major chronic diseases (including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes). They had no significant memory or physical impairments. They reported good mental health. The researchers then analyzed the associations between different types of carbohydrate intake in midlife and the odds of meeting that definition of healthy aging decades later. What Did the Study Find? The biggest takeaway was simple: quality counts when it comes to carbs and aging. Women who ate more high-quality carbohydrates-specifically those found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes-had significantly greater odds of aging in good health. Every 10% increase in calories from these types of carbs was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy aging. Eating more fiber-rich foods was also linked to better outcomes. The analysis found that consuming high-quality carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, as well as higher total dietary fiber during midlife, was associated with a 6% to 37% higher chance of healthy aging and improvements in various aspects of mental and physical health. Meanwhile, diets high in refined carbohydrates-those from added sugars, white bread and other processed grains-were linked to worse outcomes. Women who ate more refined carbs had a 13% lower likelihood of aging well. Starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn were also associated with poorer aging markers, particularly when consumed in large amounts. The researchers also examined glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL), which reflect how much and how quickly a carbohydrate-rich food raises blood sugar. A higher GI and a higher carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio were both associated with significantly lower odds of healthy aging. Interestingly, GL was positively associated with healthy aging, but that association weakened when fiber intake was factored in-suggesting that fiber-rich foods were driving the benefit. Finally, the researchers looked at what would happen if certain macronutrients were replaced with high-quality carbs. Replacing refined carbohydrates, fat or animal protein with high-quality carbs resulted in a 7% to 16% increase in the odds of healthy aging. How Does This Apply to Real Life? The good news is that the ""high-quality carbs"" linked to healthy aging are easy to find in your local grocery store-and likely already part of your diet. And if you want to add more of them to your noshing routine, we have some recipes and recommendations to help you on that front. You can start by choosing whole grains more often. Opt for brown rice, quinoa, oats, bulgur or farro instead of white rice or refined pasta. Recipes like our Farro Salad with Grilled Chicken or brown rice-packed Chicken, Spinach and Rice Casserole make whole grains as tasty as they are nutritious. We also know that piling on the produce is a great choice for healthy carbs. Try adding an extra serving of vegetables or fruit to each meal. Frozen and canned options (without added sugar or salt) are great, affordable choices. Adding legumes to your routine can help, too. Beans, lentils and chickpeas are budget-friendly, fiber-packed sources of plant-based carbs and protein. They're the stars of delicious bites like our Marry Me Lentils and Chickpea & Sweet Potato Grain Bowls. And making some snacking changes could help you out, too-especially if you tend to opt for more processed, refined snacks. Try switching processed favorites like crackers and chips for options like fresh fruit, roasted chickpeas or whole-grain toast with nut butter. These small changes can build up over time, potentially helping to preserve your mental clarity, physical strength and overall well-being well into your later years. The Bottom Line A new study in JAMA Network Open suggests that women who eat more high-quality carbs in midlife may experience better health as they age. Women who ate more fiber-rich foods and carbs from fruits, veggies and whole grains in midlife had better odds of staying healthy, active and sharp as they got older. This study adds to growing evidence that not all carbs are created equal-especially when it comes to aging well. Choosing more whole, plant-based carbs over refined ones could be a simple yet powerful strategy to support healthy aging."

But, according to new data, more parents are taking a critical step to protect their youngest kids. According to Truveta, a health care data and analytics company, 20% of Texas children younger than 2 years old who got a measles vaccine received their measles vaccine early to help prevent the disease. Advertisement The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually recommends children get their measles vaccines starting at 1 year old, but amid the measles outbreak, the CDC said in March that children can get their measles vaccines starting at 6 months old. Truveta found that the percentage of children getting vaccinated starting at 6 months old in March and April 2025 markedly increased from 2019, when the U.S. had a measles outbreak with a total of 1,261 cases. Nina Masters, the senior applied research scientist at Truveta, told HuffPost that this data is good news. Advertisement ""This means that parents are trying to protect their kids early,"" she said. Texas has seen its worst measles outbreak in nearly 30 years. Measles, a viral respiratory illness, is one of the most contagious diseases, and a vaccine is the best protection against it, according to the CDC. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of Health and Human Services, has been at the forefront of spreading conspiracy theories about vaccines for years. After an unvaccinated 8-year-old Texas girl died of measles last month, Kennedy attended her funeral and then conceded that the combined measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the disease, though he continues to push alternative treatments and describe vaccination as an individual choice. Katherine Wells, director of public health for Lubbock, Texas' health department, did not respond to HuffPost's request for information, but she told NBC News in February that the city's health department has been vaccinating children from families who didn't believe in vaccines before. Advertisement ""People are more and more nervous,"" Wells told NBC News. ""We've vaccinated multiple kids that have never been vaccinated before, some from families that didn't believe in vaccines."" Truveta's data only included children who received care from a health care professional at least three times in their first year of life. But Texas' measles outbreak has largely affected the unvaccinated, like the Mennonites, an Anabaptist Christian group whose members are typically underimmunized. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Malaria parasites, which kill nearly 600,000 people a year, mostly children, are spread by female mosquitoes when they drink blood. Current efforts aim to kill mosquitoes with insecticide rather than curing them of malaria. But a team at Harvard University has found a pair of drugs which can successfully rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs. Coating bed nets in the drug cocktail is the long-term aim. Sleeping under a bed net has been one of the most successful ways of preventing malaria as the main malaria-spreading mosquitoes hunt at night. Vaccines to protect children living in high-risk malaria areas are also recommended. Nets are both a physical barrier and also contain insecticides which kill mosquitoes that land on them. But mosquitoes have become resistant to insecticide in many countries so the chemicals no longer kill the insects as effectively as they used to. ""We haven't really tried to directly kill parasites in the mosquito before this, because we were just killing the mosquito,"" says researcher Dr Alexandra Probst, from Harvard. However, she says that approach is ""no longer cutting it""."

A Cambridge University-led study of more than 9,000 women found using different scans from traditional mammograms could treble the number of cancers detected in this group of women. Around one in 10 women have very dense breasts and they have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, however cancers are harder to spot in dense breasts because of the way mammograms (breast x-rays) work. This is because they look whiter on the x-rays, the same colour as early-stage cancers. The trial, co-ordinated from Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, tested different scanning methods on women with very dense breasts who had been given a mammogram and told they did not have cancer. It is only through mammograms that women and their health professionals can identify breasts that are very dense. 'Extra scan spotted my cancer' Louise Duffield, 60, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, was one of the trial participants who had an early-stage breast cancer diagnosed. She had surgery to have the tumour removed within weeks. She says it was a ""big shock"" when she got the diagnosis. ""It's been a stressful time and it's a huge relief to have it gone. The tumour was deep in the breast so if I hadn't been on the trial, it could have gone unnoticed for years."" Other Louise Duffield has had surgery to remove the tumour found by additional scan The study, published in The Lancet, found two alternative methods, an enhanced mammogram and a fast MRI scan, detected 17-19 cancers per 1,000 women screened. Both techniques use injections to make blood vessels more visible - tumours in the breast have a lot of blood vessels. By contrast, traditional mammograms detect eight cancers in every 1,000 women screened. This amounts to more than 20,000 cancers currently detected each year. Women aged 50 to 71 are invited for breast screening every three years and around two thirds take up the offer. Based on the study results and that level of uptake, using the different scanning techniques on women with very dense breasts could identify 3,500 extra cancers per year and potentially save 700 lives.

Acidogenic foods, like red and processed meats, create acid in your body. Eating more plants has been correlated with a lower risk of GI cancers. Our bodies work hard 24/7 to maintain internal stability-called homeostasis-with the multitude of processes going on inside them. One of these processes is maintaining a healthy pH, which is the balance between acid and base. The pH scale runs from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral-anything below 7 is acidic, and anything above it is basic or alkaline. For example, stomach (hydrochloric) acid needs to be very acidic for proper digestion. It ranks at about a 1, just above battery acid, but your blood pH should be at a neutral 7. And our bodies have amazing built-in mechanisms for regulating and maintaining blood pH. For example, if your body senses excessive levels of acid, your lungs and kidneys go to work to remedy the situation by expelling carbon dioxide through breathing and urinating. Or the pancreas will secrete bicarbonate, a compound that helps buffer acid. While the body is designed to adjust to its environment to bring it back to center, there are some questions as to whether too much of certain foods might play a role in creating a more acidic environment, especially in the gastrointestinal tract. This then lends to questioning whether a more acidic GI tract increases the risk of GI cancers, including liver, colorectal, gastric (stomach), pancreatic and esophageal cancers. Researchers in Korea observed that there is some evidence that people who eat a Western-style diet-one high in fat and sugar-create a more acidic environment in their bodies that is favorable for malignant cell growth. They took a closer look at this theory and recently published their findings in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Let's break them down. How Was This Study Conducted? Data was drawn from a long-term Korean study called the Cancer Screenee Cohort, which began in 2002. Almost 11,000 participants were used for this current study, about 64% of them female, with an average age at baseline of 53. Participants were followed on average for eight years. Participants had completed food frequency questionnaires, from which researchers calculated ""dietary acid loads"" using three different methods. Researchers determined the number of GI cancer cases using the 2020 Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, which records most instances of cancer in the country. In addition, they checked electronic medical records to catch any cases that might not have been recorded in the cancer incidence database. Demographic information that would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included BMI (which was measured by trained staff), physical activity levels, education level, occupation, marital status, first-degree family history of cancer, smoking status and alcohol intake. What Did This Study Find? Overall, researchers found that individuals who were diagnosed with GI cancer tended to have a more acidogenic diet than those without GI cancer. And as the dietary acid load score increased, so did the risk of GI cancer. This association was much stronger in males compared to females. For this study, researchers note red and processed meats as being the primary acidic foods. Researchers aren't sure why male participants had a higher risk of GI cancers than female participants, even when dietary acid load scores were similar, but offer a few possible explanations. First, they state that females tend to have better kidney function than males, thereby giving females a greater capacity for acid-base balance maintenance. They also state that there could be sex hormones involved, since estrogen tends to have a protective effect at the cellular level-which then raises the question for post-menopausal women. Lastly, in this analysis, the males tended to have higher acidic diets, including higher alcohol intake. It's important to note a few limitations of this study. First, this study cannot determine causation. In other words, it cannot conclude that eating more acidic foods, which include red and processed meats, causes GI cancer. It can only suggest a strong association between the two. There may be other factors at work, as well, such as genetics or smoking and high alcohol intake, though these were adjusted for in the analysis. Researchers also note that they could not take supplement use into consideration as a confounder since there wasn't enough information on that (certain supplements may raise or lower acid load). Finally, they note that the study population was relatively small, which may have reduced the statistical power of the analysis. How Does This Apply to Real Life? You've probably seen ads for alkaline water, thanks to companies jumping on the idea that we can control the acid-base balance in our bodies. And though this study would certainly lean that direction, there is still so much we don't yet know. While our bodies are designed to constantly work to maintain internal stability, is it possible that they can go into acid overload from certain foods that end up hijacking the body's biological systems? There is evidence that suggests yes, but don't go investing in expensive bottled water just yet. These researchers suggest a simpler swap-red and processed meats for fruits and veggies, which tend to be more alkaline. Exceptions include citrus fruits and tomatoes, which rank from 2 to 4 on the pH scale. But this doesn't mean you shouldn't eat them. Citrus fruits and tomatoes offer loads of nutrition and health benefits, including immune support and antioxidants that calm inflammation. Citrus fruits are even connected with a lower rate of colon cancer-which raises the question about whether it's really the acid load or something else about red and processed meats that might increase the GI cancer risk, since citrus fruits are more acidic. The key is to eat a variety of foods, including different types of plants-fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. This not only ensures you get the nutrients your body needs, but also spreads out the pH levels among the plants you're eating. Do a quick assessment of your eating pattern. Are you including a lot of red and processed meats? How about foods and beverages with high levels of added sugar? Where can you start rotating in more plants? Eating habits, like other habits, are pathways in our brains. These pathways were forged somewhere in your past and became automatic. To start new habits, you need to make purposeful, intentional choices because, otherwise, your brain will automatically choose the path of least resistance. Habit change tends to be easier for people if they start small. Choose an area you're likely to have success with, so that you can build on that success over time. For example, could you exchange one of your daily sodas or energy drinks for a flavored sparkling water (so you're still getting the bubbles)? If you typically have that beverage for a midafternoon energy boost, could you instead have an energizing snack-like a handful of nuts and a piece of fruit-to accomplish the same thing? Or sometimes we just need to change our physiology for an energy boost, in which case, taking a quick break from your desk and walking a lap or two around your house or office space might do the trick. These researchers also mention the Mediterranean diet as an eating pattern characterized by high fruit and vegetable intake and low or moderate meat intake. Because of this, the Mediterranean diet is associated with high levels of adiponectin, a compound known for its protective role against cancer. If you're ready to dive in and work on changing your overall eating pattern, we've got plenty of Mediterranean diet meal plans and recipes to choose from. We suggest starting with our 7-Day Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for Beginners or our 30-Day Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for Beginners. We've also got Mediterranean diet meal plans based on specific needs, so whether you're looking for more energy, less inflammation, or a heart- or gut-healthy plan, there's something for everyone. The Bottom Line This study suggests that regularly eating highly acidic foods, including red and processed meats, may increase the risk of GI cancers. These foods have also been linked with higher rates of dementia, diabetes and heart disease, so by limiting or avoiding them, you're doing your body good on many levels. Start swapping these foods with more plants, including plant-based proteins, like legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, to help lower inflammation and your overall disease risk."

Health officials are now monitoring more than 120 individuals who may have been exposed to the disease. According to the Sachem School District, 116 students and seven staff members were identified as having had prolonged contact with the infected student, and were offered tests on Monday at the school's East Campus. Individuals who were tested received TB skin testing administered by the Suffolk County Health Department. Results from those tests typically take 48 hours to process. So far, there have been no additional cases confirmed within the school community, but the investigation is ongoing. Concerned parents are demanding more information and greater transparency from school and health officials. ""What's being done to ensure the safety of the kids when we, as parents or guardians, send them to school?"" asked Janie Gallo, a Farmingville resident and parent. Tuberculosis is a potentially serious bacterial infection that typically affects the lungs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says TB spreads through the air when a person with active TB disease coughs, sneezes or talks. Symptoms may include a persistent cough, chest pain, fatigue and fever. As of now, the New York State Department of Health reports there have been 16 confirmed TB cases in Suffolk County and 18 in neighboring Nassau County this year - numbers that are consistent with last year's data for the same time period. Health officials say those initially tested this week will need to undergo another round of testing in July, once the standard two-month TB incubation period has passed."

Measles cases going up. Vaccination rates going down. Whooping cough is making a comeback. Thousands of government experts have been fired or resigned. Amid these crises, the United States is undergoing a moment of intense distrust in public health - from multiple sides. There's the anti-vaccine community, who often distrust both America's health agencies and the big pharmaceutical companies. There are also the people who previously trusted health agencies, but are now sceptical of US President Donald Trump's administration and are particularly wary of Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr. What does it mean for health outcomes when so many people don't believe in the doctors, drug companies and the public agencies who are there to treat us? What can be done to bring trust back? For answers, I reached out to Leana Wen, a physician and writer who formerly served as commissioner of the Baltimore City Health Department. During the darkest days of the Covid-19 pandemic, I often interviewed her live on BBC News from a makeshift studio in my basement to get her insights on how to stay safe. Our conversation was a weighty one - but I found Wen's suggestions about how to approach concerned parents and vaccine sceptics to be particularly insightful at this moment. If you have a few minutes to spare, I really encourage you to watch or read a bit of our conversation below. Click play to watch Leana Wen's conversation with Katty Kay Below is an excerpt from our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity. Katty Kay: What are you worried about in terms of tangible health outcomes from this climate of mistrust? What worries you? Leana Wen: What happens to vaccine-preventable diseases tops that list, because we're going to see those impacts really quickly. We are already seeing the single largest measles outbreak in the US in the last 30 years. Measles has been eliminated since 2000, but the US could lose its measles elimination status. We are seeing rising cases of things like whooping cough. If vaccination rates for other diseases fall, we could also see a return of rubella and chickenpox and even polio - things that would really have been unthinkable just several years ago. But if you have such distrust over vaccines, that also means that there's a distrust of authority, of science, of the scientific method, of what counts as science and how one does research. And that could have negative impacts on many other aspects of health, too. KK: Are there things that work for pulling people back into a position where they might have mistrusted medical authorities, but they can then say, 'OK, yes, I can trust authority. I can trust what science is telling me?' LW: The core aspect of being a physician is the one-on-one conversation with our patients, and it's in those one-on-one conversations that we see a lot of change, because we never approach these conversations with the assumption that 'I'm right and you're wrong' or that you must have listened to all these conspiracy theories. We come to those conversations asking people what their thoughts are, what they have heard, why they believe one thing or another - and then we meet them where they are in those conversations. Often, that means that we have to overlook their opposition to vaccines, because we don't want to push them away so much. Then, they're now not willing to get treatment for their high blood pressure and diabetes, and then may go out and have a stroke. So, I think part of building that trust actually is knowing when to make the case and when not to. It's not an option to get frustrated - Leana Wen KK: If you were talking to parents of a young child who didn't want to get their child vaccinated against measles, [who are] afraid of measles vaccine and what it might do to their child, what would you say to them, doctor? LW: I think I would start by asking them some more questions about what it is that they are afraid of. Are they afraid of all vaccines, or are they just afraid of this one? What exactly is the concern? So, for example, if they're citing what they think is a possible link between the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine and autism, I would point to the dozens of studies that have been done, including published in the New England Journal, that have debunked this association and the growing amount of evidence that whether you get autism was determined before birth. It is not determined after birth and in connection with vaccines. On the other hand, if what they're concerned about is all vaccines, because they don't believe that measles is that serious, then I would point to the reality about measles: that yes, it's true that most people who get measles will have a mild case of it, but one in five will have pneumonia. One in 20 will end up being hospitalised. One to three out of a thousand children with measles will die. So, I think it really depends on what those specific concerns are. But ultimately, the message is very straightforward: Vaccines are safe. They're effective. They're life-saving. KK: Do you think, in the environment we're living in, that it is sometimes impossible to persuade people because it's almost tribal? As somebody who is a scientist and a doctor, how personally frustrating is that? LW: I think back to what the individual conversations with patients will look like, because it's not an option to get frustrated. And you could say, 'OK, we're not going to touch this subject for the time being, because we're not going to make headway'. And again, I don't want to drive you, the patient, away from all the other recommendations that are important for your health. If you don't see me as the doctor, maybe you'll go to somebody else who will take offense to what you're saying about vaccines and then you won't get any medical treatment. That's not a good outcome. I think it is reasonable to put aside certain differences and maybe try to approach it later and focus on areas of common ground. But I think that most of all, it's really important to not approach the individual who you don't agree with with scorn or scepticism or anger, because that's only going to elicit a defensive reaction. KK: In April, after two small children died of measles, Health [and Human Services] Secretary Robert F Kennedy endorsed the MMR vaccine, which prevents measles. He then got attacked online from people who are in the anti-vax camp who were very disappointed that he had come out and endorsed the vaccine. A day later, he posted a photograph of himself with a couple of doctors who are opposed to vaccines, to the MMR vaccines. And he called them extraordinary healers. And he also promoted some unproven treatments. So, I'm quite confused about where the health secretary stands on vaccines. And I imagine if my kids were still young and I was at the stage where I was having to look at getting them vaccinated, I, as a parent, might be quite confused, as well. Are you clear about where the health secretary stands, particularly on the measles vaccine, given the outbreak of measles in the country at the moment? LW: Yes, I am very clear on where RFK Jr stands, although I think that your interpretation of it is very fair and also very correct. You are confused because he intends for it to be confusing, because he is trying to speak to two very, very different constituencies who have completely opposing goals. On the one hand, RFK Jr is a well-known vaccine conspiracy theorist who, for dozens of years, founded and ran an anti-vaccine organisation. He's seen as a champion by people who head up the anti-vaccine movements themselves. So, that is a core constituency that got him into this role and he has to placate them. So, he's said many things that are very harmful and untrue. Playing down, for example, the seriousness of the measles infection, talking about treatments that are not treatments. To be clear, there is no specific antiviral that will cure measles. So, he talks about steroids and antibiotics and things that are not treatments for measles. In a way, that also plays down the seriousness of the disease - people mistakenly think that there is a treatment that there is not. At the same time, he continues to spread doubt about the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. He has said in recent weeks that it causes just as much illness as measles itself. He has continued to promote the debunked allegation that the MMR vaccine is tied to autism. He's announced research to study this conspiracy. So, he's currently walking this line between trying to appease the anti-vaccine camp and trying to appease some people, including moderate Republicans, who are trying to get him to say things like, 'Well, the measles vaccine is a good thing'. So, he's trying to say both of these things and that's why it comes out sounding confused, because that's, in fact, how he intends it. [In a statement to the BBC, Vianca N Rodriguez Feliciano, press secretary at the US Department of Health and Human Services, said that the department is committed to building public trust in science and, specifically, ""Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine - he is pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability"". Feliciano added that ""claims that Secretary Kennedy is spreading misinformation or undermining vaccine confidence are flat-out false. These accusations ignore the facts and distract from the urgent public health work underway"".] KK: Was there anything that's been done in the last three months that you think has been good on the health front in America, amid all of these changes? LW: Look, I think that a reexamination of how certain things have always been done is a good idea. So, for example, do we have the most efficient processes for approving new drugs? Can we be deploying artificial intelligence in a more thoughtful way? I think that it's fine and necessary even for us to be probing in this way. In addition, I think that there are parts of Make America Healthy Again, Robert F Kennedy Jr's movement, that may be helpful. It's hard to disagree with him when he speaks about trying to cut chronic diseases. It's hard to disagree with him when he speaks about cutting out ultra-processed food or improving childhood nutrition. These are all good things, necessary things for us to be aiming for. The only question, though, of course, is what else comes along with these goals? --"

These uniquely human folds appear to bring critical brain regions closer together, enhancing communication and cognitive function. In an fMRI study, deeper tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices were linked to stronger connections and better reasoning performance. The findings suggest that sulcal depth could serve as a potential biomarker for cognitive development or neurodevelopmental disorders. Key Facts: Tertiary Sulci Role: These small, late-developing brain folds are connected to reasoning ability. These small, late-developing brain folds are connected to reasoning ability. Enhanced Connectivity: Deeper sulci may bring brain regions closer, boosting neural efficiency. Deeper sulci may bring brain regions closer, boosting neural efficiency. Developmental Marker: Sulcal structure could help identify individual differences in cognition. Source: UC Berkeley Many grooves and dimples on the surface of the brain are unique to humans, but they're often dismissed as an uninteresting consequence of packing an unusually large brain into a too-small skull. But neuroscientists are finding that these folds are not mere artifacts, like the puffy folds you get when forcing a sleeping bag into a stuff sack. The depths of some of the smallest of these grooves seem to be linked to increased interconnectedness in the brain and better reasoning ability. Weiner's lab is creating a computer program to help researchers identify tertiary sulci in the human brain. Credit: Neuroscience News In a study published May 19 in The Journal of Neuroscience, University of California, Berkeley, researchers show that in children and adolescents, the depths of some small grooves are correlated with increased connectivity between regions of the brain - the lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex - involved in reasoning and other high-level cognitive functions. The grooves may actually bring those areas closer together in space, shortening the connections between them and speeding communications. The implication, the researchers say, is that variability in these small grooves, which are called tertiary sulci (pronounced sul'-sigh), may help explain individual differences in cognitive performance, and could serve as diagnostic indicators or biomarkers of reasoning ability or neurodevelopmental disorders. ""The impetus for this study was having seen that sulcal depth correlated with reasoning across children and adolescents,"" said Silvia Bunge, professor of psychology and a member of UC Berkeley's Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (HWNI). ""Given our previous findings, our former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Hakkinen aimed to test if sulcal depth was correlated with reasoning performance and to test if patterns of coordinated activity within a lateral prefrontal-parietal network could explain this relation between sulcal depth and reasoning."" ""We had explicit predictions about which tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex would be functionally connected to tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, and that panned out,"" added Kevin Weiner, UC Berkeley associate professor of psychology and of neuroscience and a member of HWNI. ""Prefrontal and parietal cortices aside, the hypothesis is that the formation of sulci leads to shortened distances between connected brain regions, which could lead to increased neural efficiency, and then, in turn, individual differences in improved cognition with translational applications."" ""The cortex is sort of haphazardly crunched up into the brain - that's what I was always taught,"" Bunge said. ""Kevin came along and changed my mind about sulci."" The hills and valleys of the brain The brains of most animals, mammals included, have smooth surfaces. Primates have hills and valleys covering their cerebral cortex. While one group of primates, the New World monkeys called marmosets, have shallow, barely perceptible sulci, those of humans are deeply incised, with between 60% and 70% of the cortex buried in these folds. The cortical folding patterns in humans also change with age, establishing their final structure late in prenatal development while becoming less prominent in old age. ""While sulci can change over development, getting deeper or shallower and developing thinner or thicker gray matter - probably in ways that depend on experience - our particular configuration of sulci is a stable individual difference: their size, shape, location and even, for a few sulci, whether they're present or absent,"" said Bunge, who studies abstract reasoning in young people, from 6 years of age through young adulthood. The smallest grooves, many of which are uniquely human, are called tertiary sulci because they appear last in prenatal development and are never as deep as the major or primary sulci that are most evident on the cerebral surface. Scientists have speculated that the tertiary sulci emerge in parts of the human brain that have expanded the most throughout evolution and have a protracted development, and that they are likely associated with aspects of cognition - reasoning, decision-making, planning and self-control - that develop over a protracted adolescence. But prior to this study, evidence was lacking for a connection between tertiary sulci and brain connectivity. The UC Berkeley study is one of few, all within the past few years, to provide such proof. Sulci linked to cognition Weiner and Bunge said that, as undergraduates, they were never taught how to define tertiary sulci; they often examined scans of average brains that did not match any specific individual. Weiner noticed this mismatch as an undergraduate. ""At the time, all I knew was that I had some cortical squiggles that weren't in the average brain atlases that we had in the lab. So the question I asked my mentors, Sabine Kastner and Charlie Gross, was: Do I have different structures that aren't in our atlases or are structures missing from these atlases?"" he said. ""That sent me down a 15-year rabbit hole studying one particular tertiary sulcus in the visual cortex."" That work showed that a specific sulcus, the mid-fusiform sulcus, varied in length from as small as 3 millimeters to as long as 7 centimeters in any given person. Moreover, the longer the sulcus, the better a person was at processing and recognizing human faces. ""About 2% of individuals have developmental prosopagnosia, which means they can't perceive faces, and they don't have any brain damage,"" he said. ""That sulcus, especially in the right hemisphere, is shorter and shallower in those folks than in what we refer to as neurotypical controls."" Building on that rabbit hole, Bunge and Weiner wondered whether tertiary sulci in other regions of the brain, outside the visual processing units, also correlated with cognitive ability. Upon moving to UC Berkeley in 2018, Weiner began investigating the prefrontal cortex - located in the front of the brain behind the forehead - in collaboration with Bunge, who wanted to test whether sulci in this area would be linked to reasoning. In a 2021 paper, the two collaborated to define all the smaller sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex and created a computer model that identified the tertiary sulci as contributing the most variation in reasoning ability. ""The model identified that there's tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex that are contributing to reasoning skills in kids,"" Weiner said. Expanding on that work in the new study, Weiner, Bunge and their colleagues painstakingly catalogued the tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, located under and just behind the crown of the skull, and investigated its functional connections with the sulci of the lateral prefrontal cortex. For both studies, they studied 43 participants, 20 of them female, who ranged in age from 7 to 18. While in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, the participants were given a reasoning task. The researchers focused on the brain activity in 21 sulci they had identified in each hemisphere of the brain, and the functional connections between these sulci - including, for the first time, tertiary sulci. Across these individuals, greater depth for several of the sulci implicated in reasoning was associated with higher network centrality across the set of prefrontal and parietal sulci. Experience affects sulci Bunge pointed out that the association between depths of sulci and reasoning does not hold for all sulci, and that sulcal depth may change with experience. ""Do we think that an individual's capacity for reasoning is set in stone based on their cortical folding? No!,"" she said. ""Cognitive function depends on variability in a variety of anatomical and functional features and, importantly, we know that experience, like quality of schooling, plays a powerful role in shaping an individual's cognitive trajectory, and that it is malleable, even in adulthood."" Weiner's lab is creating a computer program to help researchers identify tertiary sulci in the human brain. Most programs only identify about 35 sulci, but when tertiary sulci are included, there are over 100, he said, including new ones that their labs have uncovered together. They argue that sulci could serve as landmarks to compare brains between individuals, since brains vary so much. ""Dozens of brain maps have been proposed in just the last five years, but they disagree about the areas of associated regions in the cortex, and there are mismatches between areas at the group and individual level,"" Weiner said. ""Examining network architecture based on individual sulcal morphology circumvents these disagreements and mismatches, with the opportunity to glean network-level insight from the local sulcal anatomy that is specific to a given individual."" Aside from Bunge and Weiner, other UC Berkeley co-authors of the paper are former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Hakkinen, former graduate student Willa Voorhies, former undergraduates Ethan Willbrand and Jewelia Yao, and former visiting scholars Yi-Heng Tsai and Thomas Gagnant.

""Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning"" by Silvia Bunge et al. Journal of Neuroscience Abstract Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning A salient neuroanatomical feature of the human brain is its pronounced cortical folding, and there is mounting evidence that sulcal morphology is relevant to functional brain architecture and cognition. However, our understanding of the relationships between sulcal anatomy, brain activity, and behavior is still in its infancy. We previously found that the depth of three small, shallow sulci in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was linked to reasoning performance during development (Voorhies et al., 2021). These findings beg the question: what is the linking mechanism between sulcal morphology and cognition? Here, we investigated functional connectivity among sulci in LPFC and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) in participants from the same sample as our previous study. We leveraged manual parcellations (21 sulci/hemisphere, total of 1806) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data from a reasoning task from 43 participants aged 7-18 years (20 female). We conducted clustering and classification analyses of individual-level functional connectivity among sulci. Broadly, we found that 1) the connectivity patterns of individual sulci could be differentiated - and more accurately than rotated sulcal labels equated for size and shape; 2) sulcal connectivity did not consistently correspond with that of probabilistic labels or large-scale networks; 3) sulci clustered together into groups with similar patterns, not dictated by spatial proximity; and 4) across individuals, greater depth was associated with higher network centrality for several sulci under investigation. These results illustrate how sulcal morphology can be relevant for functional connectivity, and provide proof of concept that using sulci to define an individual coordinate space for functional connectomes is a promising future direction."

One of the most common forms of dementia that surfaces in midlife is called frontotemporal dementia (FTD); this is the form that Bruce Willis was diagnosed with. In a new study published in Nature Aging, researchers used spinal tap fluid to identify potential new biomarkers for FTD which could lead personalized treatments. While most people lump dementia into one general group, the truth is that there are different forms of the disease, each with their own symptoms. The most common form of dementia that surfaces in midlife (generally talking 40s and 50s here) is called frontotemporal dementia (or FTD), and it tends to get confused with depression, schizophrenia, or Parkinson's disease before people are properly diagnosed. While Bruce Willis' diagnosis with frontotemporal dementia has put a spotlight on this form of the devastating disease, there still aren't any reliable biomarkers to detect or even monitor the condition. But now, new research has helped to pinpoint certain changes that happen in the body due to frontotemporal dementia, and the findings could eventually lead to diagnostic testing for the condition.

The researchers discovered that patients with frontotemporal dementia had changes in the proteins that suggest they have problems with RNA regulation, which is required for the correct gene expression in the brain. (Gene expression can impact how your brain works.) These patients also had certain changes that impacted connections in their brains.These proteins could be the first markers for frontotemporal dementia that surface when people develop the disease, according to the researchers.Why are these proteins so important?There are a few reasons. First, ""frontotemporal dementia can be caused by several very different types of brain pathology, making it very difficult to provide an accurate diagnosis to patients,"" explains Rowan Saloner, PhD, study co-author and professor in the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. ""Right now, we have no way to tell which pathology someone has while they're alive, especially in non-inherited cases, which make up the majority of frontotemporal dementia."" But by IDing changes in spinal fluid protein, doctors can detect the disease and track its progression. ""That will hopefully lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments,"" Saloner says. That's crucial, given that this form of dementia tends to be missed early on, says Clifford Segil, DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. But genetic testing could help give patients and their doctors a better sense of what might be behind their symptoms, he says. One thing to keep in mind: This study focused on people with an inherited or genetic form of frontotemporal dementia. ""We do not know if genetic frontotemporal dementia and sporadic frontotemporal dementia just look the same in the end but have different paths to development,"" says Amit Sachdev, MD, MS, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. ""If they have different paths, then this study has helped us learn about genetic frontotemporal dementia. That is useful but not as broadly applicable."" What else do we know about early-onset dementia?Early-onset dementias like frontotemporal dementia usually impact people in their 40s or 50s, Saloner says. ""They can be difficult to diagnose, as early symptoms are often misattributed to stress or psychiatric disorders,"" he says. ""Compared to Alzheimer's disease, which now has biomarkers and FDA-approved treatments, frontotemporal dementia remains behind."" Segil says that early-onset dementia should be considered ""if someone loses the ability to talk or express themselves and other neurological conditions like a stroke, seizure, or infection have been ruled out.""Ultimately, Sachdev says that more information is better with the disease. ""It is important to know as much as possible about how these diseases arise,"" he says. ""It gives us something to work from in everyone else."""

TODAY.com previously spoke with Dr. Eric Topol, a top cardiologist and longevity researcher, about his science-backed strategies to age healthier from his book ""Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity."" Regular exercise is one of the most effective tools to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related diseases like heart disease and cancer, Topol said. One type of exercise in particular may help slow down how fast our bodies age and keep us feeling fit and strong. Cardiologist tip of the day: Strength train at least 3 times a week As a cardiologist, Topol says he was always a fan of aerobic exercise. Over the decades, he focused on heart rate-boosting activities like running and cycling, while skipping strength and resistance training. ""That was a mistake,"" Topol explained. After researching the benefits of strength training for healthy aging, Topol changed his approach to working out and added this type of exercise to his workout routine. ""If I'm going to be old, I'd rather be strong and old,"" Topol quipped. Topol, now 70, does at least one hour of resistance and strength training three times a week, or 30 minutes of training, four to five times a week. ""I'm more fit and stronger than I can ever remember, just by doing that for over a year now,"" Topol says. Why it matters As we age, we start to lose muscle mass and strength, with the most significant declines happening after the age of 50, according to Topol. Regular strength training can help maintain muscle mass and improve bone density, all while promoting mobility and balance, which reduces the risk of falls (the leading cause of injury among adults over 65.) A 2022 systematic review found that resistance training was linked with a lower risk of death from all causes. Despite the wealth of evidence of the benefits of strength training, only one in four adults in the U.S. report meeting the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, which recommends muscle-strengthening activity at least two times per week. How to get started If you don't already have a strength training routine, don't sweat it. ""It's never too late,"" added Topol. Beginners can start with bodyweight exercises, which require no equipment or gym membership. These include squats, lunges, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and lunges, wall-sits, and planks, explained Topol. Once you're comfortable, add in light weights, starting with 5-pound dumbbells.

These delivery systems are a significant step toward future precise gene therapy to the brain that could safely control errant brain activity with high precision. In contrast, current therapies for brain disorders mostly treat only symptoms. The new delivery systems carry genetic material into the brain and spinal cord for targeted use by specific cell types. This platform has the potential to transform how scientists can study neural circuits.

""Imagine this new platform as a delivery truck dropping off specialized genetic packages in specific cell neighborhoods in the brain and spinal cord,"" said John Ngai, Director of the NIH's Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative. ""With these delivery systems, we can now access and manipulate specific cells in the brain and spinal cord - access that was not possible before at this scale."" The new delivery tools, which use a small, stripped-down adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver DNA to target cells, can be broadly applied across many species and experimental systems, including small tissue samples removed during human brain surgeries. The delivery systems have been tested, or validated, in intact living systems, which is an important step for introducing new tools for widespread use. The newly published toolkit includes: Dozens of delivery systems that selectively target key brain cell types, including excitatory neurons, inhibitory interneurons, striatal and cortical subtypes, brain blood vessel cells, and hard-to-reach neurons in the spinal cord that control body movement and are damaged in several neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy Computer programs powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can identify genetic ""light switches,"" known as enhancers, that turn genes on in specific brain cell types, using data from many different species - cutting considerable time and effort for scientists looking for these genetic switches. Overall, this collection of research tools will significantly accelerate understanding of the human brain. Importantly, the toolkit enables access to specific brain cell types in the prefrontal cortex, an area that's critical for decision-making and uniquely human traits. With other tools in the collection, scientists can better study individual cells and communication pathways known to be affected in several neurological diseases. These include seizure disorders, ALS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease - as well as various neuropsychiatric conditions. AAV-based treatments are already approved for some conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy for which a 2016 approval of a gene therapy known as Zolgensma transformed the lives of infants and young children who once faced severe disability or early death. The new collection of gene delivery resources lays the groundwork for more precise treatments that target only affected cells in the brain, spinal cord, or brain blood vessels. The toolkit is available at distribution centers including Addgene, a global supplier of genetic research tools. This collection of publications offers researchers standard operating procedures and user guides for these tools.

""An enhancer-AAV toolbox to target and manipulate distinct interneuron subtypes"" by Elisabetta Furlanis et al. Cell Abstract An enhancer-AAV toolbox to target and manipulate distinct interneuron subtypes In recent years, we and others have identified a number of enhancers that, when incorporated into rAAV vectors, can restrict the transgene expression to particular neuronal populations. Yet, viral tools to access and manipulate specific neuronal subtypes are still limited. Here, we performed systematic analysis of single-cell genomic data to identify enhancer candidates for each of the telencephalic interneuron subtypes. We established a set of enhancer-AAV tools that are highly specific for distinct cortical interneuron populations and striatal cholinergic interneurons. These enhancers, when used in the context of different effectors, can target (fluorescent proteins), observe activity (GCaMP), and manipulate (opto-genetics) specific neuronal subtypes. We also validated our enhancer-AAV tools across species. Thus, we provide the field with a powerful set of tools to study neural circuits and functions and to develop precise and targeted therapy."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain Results from the VITAL randomized controlled trial reveal that vitamin D supplementation helps maintain telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten during aging and are linked to the development of certain diseases. The new report, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, is based on data from a VITAL sub-study co-led by researchers at Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia, and supports a promising role in slowing a pathway for biological aging. ""VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,"" said co-author JoAnn Manson, MD, principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown the benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease."" Telomeres are made of repeating sequences of DNA, or base pairs, that prevent chromosome ends from degrading or fusing with other chromosomes. Telomere shortening is a natural part of aging and is associated with an increased risk of various age-related diseases. A few short-term, small-scale studies have suggested that vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may help support telomeres, but results have been inconsistent. VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and omega-3 fatty acid (1 g/day) supplementation that tracked U.S. females aged 55 years and older and males aged 50 years and older for five years. The VITAL Telomere sub-study included 1,054 of these participants, whose telomere length in white blood cells was assessed at baseline and at Year 2 and Year 4. Compared with taking placebo, taking vitamin D3 supplements significantly reduced telomere shortening over four years, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging compared with placebo. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation had no significant effect on telomere length throughout follow-up. ""Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,"" said Haidong Zhu, Ph.D., first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University."
The pros and cons of PSA tests for prostate cancer for midlife and older men - NPR,health,"With Biden's prostate cancer in the news, men may be wondering whether and at what age to be screened.

Part of the problem is identifying and treating aggressive cancers like Biden's while not unnecessarily treating men with slow-growing cancers unlikely to sicken them. Autopsies found the disease to be so widespread that more than one-third of white men and half of Black men in their 70s had prostate cancers that would never do any harm. Sponsor Message ""PSA testing alone leaves a lot to be desired as a cancer screening test,"" said radiation oncologist Dr. Brent Rose, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine. The test measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by normal as well as malignant prostate gland cells, in the blood. Elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer. It also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects, including impotence, incontinence and bowel dysfunction. ""PSA screening is beneficial,"" Rose said. ""There are risks, though, and so it is a personal decision whether or not to do PSA screening."" The key is to target and treat aggressive cancers while waiting and watching cancers that might never become troublesome, Rose and other oncologists told NPR. Physicians have been walking this tightrope since they began regularly using PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer in healthy men in the 1990s. There is no other test that effectively screens for prostate cancer - the second deadliest cancer for American men, oncologists said. A history of conflicting guidance Attempts to balance the possible harms against the number of lives saved have led to two decades of fluctuating - and confusing - public health guidelines on PSA screening. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advised against any screening, only to issue a watered-down recommendation in 2018 that men ages 55 to 69 discuss screening with their health care providers. Various physicians' groups offer conflicting guidance for this age group. In its advice to older men, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has been somewhat more consistent. In 2008, the independent panel of national experts recommended men 75 and older not be screened, and since 2018, the panel has advised against screening men 70 and older. Sponsor Message Biden, 82, apparently followed the guidance. He last had a PSA screening test in 2014, when he was 71 or 72 years old, a spokesman said. For men between the ages of 55 and 69, the task force recommends talking to their health care providers about their preferences before deciding whether to get a PSA test. It classifies the recommendation as Grade C, which means it offers only a small benefit and insurers may not cover it. Finding the time to have a conversation about a topic as complicated as the value of prostate-cancer screening can be challenging for most primary-care physicians, oncologists interviewed for this story said. And while some men might welcome what's called ""shared decision-making,"" others find it agonizing. Still, the only advice for men for now is to talk the issue over carefully with their doctors. The case for the PSA test Dr. Alicia Morgans, a genitourinary medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, recognizes the problem and hopes that the task force will address it in new guidelines, which it is currently drafting. In August, she met with the volunteer panel in her role as chair of the medical advisory board for the advocacy group Zero Prostate Cancer. Morgans believes the current guidance was based on a flawed clinical trial. It concluded that men screened with PSA tests were no less likely to die of prostate cancer than men assigned to a group that was not screened. But the results were muddied because nearly 90% of the men in the control group had at least one PSA test before or during the trial, she said. Morgans would like to see the recommendation beefed up so more men get screened for prostate cancer and Black men and men with a family history, who are more vulnerable, get screened earlier. ""I take care of people who have very advanced prostate cancer, as well as some people who have curable prostate cancer,"" she said, ""so my perspective is really skewed by the fact that I really want to make that diagnosis when things are curable."" Sponsor Message So does Dr. Matthew Cooperberg, a urologic oncologist and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. He has pushed to rename early-stage prostate cancer in part to ease the stress of a cancer diagnosis. One possible name, ""acinar neoplasm,"" describes an abnormal growth but one lacking the potential to spread or kill. Cooperberg also advocates monitoring men with elevated PSAs before rushing to biopsy their prostates. ""Men should get PSA testing in midlife with the goal of finding aggressive prostate cancer,"" he said. ""If we find low-grade disease along the way, whether or not we call it cancer, we should not treat it. We just monitor it with active surveillance. If we do that, we can erase this cancer."" A new approach to prostate cancer screening emerges Dr. Tyler Seibert, a radiation oncologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, is not as optimistic about eliminating prostate cancer. But he too is dedicated to finding ways to identify the bad prostate cancers and treating only them. When doctors first began doing PSA screening tests, he said, ""there was a flawed assumption that was implicit that if you find any kind of prostate cancer, you must treat that kind of prostate cancer aggressively,"" he said. ""Many of them would never have harmed the patient."" A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, Seibert believes. Today, instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, he and an increasing number of prostate-cancer specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting. ""For these patients with low-risk prostate cancer, we have really strong evidence that we can follow them closely, and they basically can just carry on with their life,"" he said. Not everyone is comfortable with getting periodic blood tests to see if their PSA might be rising and they might indeed need cancer treatment, Seibert acknowledged. But most of his patients do become comfortable with the protocol, he said. Sponsor Message ""Every time you get that blood test, you're kind of a little bit nervous,"" he said. ""If you can tolerate that, and you don't think that it's going to be causing you too much anxiety, then screening makes a lot of sense.""

The study, ""Corneal confocal microscopy differentiates patients with secondary parkinsonism from idiopathic Parkinson's disease,"" was published in NPJ Parkinson's Disease. Recommended Reading Distinct immune responses may detect Parkinson's before symptoms Parkinson's can cause abnormalities in nerves connecting eyes and brain Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the dysfunction and death of brain cells that are responsible for making the chemical messenger dopamine. Parkinson's is marked by motor symptoms such as slowed movement, tremor, stiffness, and balance issues. Most people with Parkinson's have idiopathic disease, meaning the underlying cause is not known. Secondary parkinsonism refers to health conditions that can cause Parkinson's-like motor symptoms, but are not actually Parkinson's disease. Secondary parkinsonism can develop due to drugs or toxins, or because of problems with blood flow or fluid pressure in and around the brain. Since secondary parkinsonism is by definition characterized by symptoms that are similar to Parkinson's disease, it can be difficult for clinicians to tell the two apart. Parkinson's disease can cause abnormalities in the nerves that connect the eyes to the brain, which are generally less affected in secondary parkinsonism. These nerves can be visualized using a technique called corneal confocal microscopy, or CCM. In this study, scientists in China tested whether CCM might be used to reliably distinguish between true Parkinson's disease and secondary parkinsonism. CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson's disease]. The study included 45 people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 25 with secondary parkinsonism. The researchers found patients with Parkinson's had a lower density of nerve fibers detected by CCM than those with secondary parkinsonism. They also tended to have more branch-like protrusions on their nerves than those with secondary parkinsonism. To test if these CCM-based measures could distinguish between the two conditions, the researchers calculated a statistical value called the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This is a statistical test of how well a measure (in this case, CCM) can distinguish between two groups, Parkinson's or secondary parkinsonism in this study. AUC values can range from 0.5 to 1, with higher numbers reflecting better accuracy. The AUC for CCM in this study was 0.924, suggesting high accuracy for distinguishing true Parkinson's from secondary parkinsonism. The researchers noted they could get even better accuracy if they also included clinical measures like assessments of symptom severity. ""CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson's disease],"" the scientists concluded."

The treatment, called VERVE-102, could transform the future of heart attack prevention by dramatically reducing a person's levels of LDL cholesterol - the so-called bad' cholesterol - with just one injection. While statins can lower a person's cholesterol levels by similar levels, these generally need to be taken daily. ""This is the future,"" Prof Riyaz Patel - an academic cardiologist at University College London and a doctor at Barts Health NHS Trust, which has taken part in the trial - told BBC Science Focus. ""This is reality; it's not science fiction. We're actually doing it. I've had patients of mine in the trial receive this one-and-done treatment, and it's going to change the face of cholesterol management going forward."" Instead of managing cholesterol over time like statins, VERVE-102 aims to provide a one-time fix by switching off' a specific gene, known as PCSK9, in the liver. This gene plays a key role in regulating how much LDL cholesterol the liver can detect and remove from the bloodstream. Essentially, less PCSK9 leads to less LDL in the bloodstream. ""We're seeing some spectacular results,"" said Patel. ""This drug turns off a tiny fraction of DNA, and your LDL cholesterol is lower by 50 per cent for the rest of your life. That's it. One and done. This is going to be revolutionary."" Cholesterol can build up in the walls of blood vessels, forming plaques that may eventually rupture and block blood flow. High levels of LDL cholesterol increase the risk of this buildup, which is why millions of people (over 40 million in the US, and 7 million in the UK) take daily medications like statins to help keep their cholesterol levels under control. The VERVE-102 clinical trial involved 14 participants with familial hypercholesterolemia: a genetic condition that predisposes people to heart disease, heart attacks and strokes, due to very high LDL cholesterol levels. Initial results of the VERVE-102 injection indicate that all participants responded well to the medication, with no serious side effects. Different doses led to different responses; the four individuals given the lowest dose of VERVE-102 saw average reductions in their LDL cholesterol of 21 per cent, while the middle cohort had reductions of 41 per cent, and the highest dose resulted in reductions of 53 per cent. But one participant, in the high-dose group, reduced their LDL cholesterol by 69 per cent after receiving VERVE-102. Dr Eugene Braunwald - Distinguished Hersey Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, who was not personally involved in this study - added the initial trial data was ""promising"" and that it suggested ""the potential for a new era of cardiovascular disease treatment."" Verve is currently recruiting participants in a further stage of their clinical trial, who will receive an even higher dose of VERVE-102, in the UK, Canada, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. It expects to announce its final results in the second half of 2025.

Rising cases of tick-borne illnesses prompted the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to issue a warning Wednesday, May 21, ahead of the holiday weekend when residents may be spending more time outdoors. ""Preventing tick bites is the best way to prevent tick-borne diseases,"" said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive. ""If you find a tick attached to your body, promptly remove it. Monitor your health, and if you experience fever, rash, muscle or joint aches or other symptoms, or if you suspect a tick has been attached for more than 24 hours, consult with your medical provider."" Related: Tick season altered by Michigan's second warmest winter Lyme disease and anaplasmosis are transmitted by the blacklegged or deer tick, commonly found in wooded or brushy areas in both of Michigan's peninsulas. They've been expanding their range in recent years. Symptoms of tick-borne disease typically begin within two weeks of a tick bite. Early signs may include fever or chills, rash, headache, fatigue and muscle aches. Many people with Lyme disease will develop a bull's-eye rash that begins at the site of the bite and expands over several days. Early treatment with antibiotics is the best way to reduce risk of serious complications like neurological and heart problems and arthritis. MDHHS recommends avoiding contact with overgrown grass, brush and leaf litter at trail edges when traversing grassy, brushy and wooded areas. Officials also recommend using an EPA-registered insect repellent on exposed skin and/or treat clothing with permethrin, which kills ticks on contact. Don't use permethrin directly on skin. Perform a tick check on yourself and your animals after being outdoors. Remove attached ticks with tweezers by grabbing them as close to the skin as possible, and cleanse the area with antiseptic. In addition to the 1,215 Lyme disease cases reported in 2024, Michigan also identified 82 cases of anaplasmosis. That was up from 17 cases in 2020.

In season two of The Last of Us, the cordyceps fungus-spoiler alert-becomes airborne, meaning the fungal infection can spread not just through bites but also when humans inhale its spores. While the TV show is highly fictitious, airborne fungi are most certainly not. A U.S. family now knows this better than most, since 12 of their members became ill after touring a bat cave in Costa Rica. In a paper published Thursday in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers described 12 confirmed or probable cases of histoplasmosis: a pulmonary infection caused by inhaling the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This fungus lives in soil, frequently alongside bird or bat droppings, and can become airborne if the earth is disturbed. While symptoms are usually subtle, the infection can make infants and immunocompromised people vulnerable to more serious illnesses. During a vacation to Costa Rica in December of last year, 12 of 13 family members toured the bat-colonized Venado Caves, an ancient cave system and popular tourist destination. This essentially meant crawling through bat poop for two hours. When they returned to the U.S., everyone-except the one family member who hadn't toured the cave-became ill to varying degrees, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, night sweats, respiratory problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Five family members sought medical attention. Doctors tested four of them for fungal infections, and two tested positive for histoplasma. Two of the patients also had abnormal chest X-rays, one of which raised concern for possible lung cancer. After learning about their spelunking expedition, healthcare providers notified the CDC, which launched an investigation. Notably, the cave they had visited had also likely caused a histoplasmosis outbreak in 1998 and 1999. ""Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame,"" the team, led by CDC researchers, wrote in the report. ""However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives."" In other words, given that it's harder to detect histoplasmosis in healthy patients, the family members who tested negative might still have had histoplasmosis. Ultimately, doctors confirmed that one family member had histoplasmosis, eight members probably did, and three were suspected of having it. Fortunately, none of them became zombies-or had lung cancer-and within 28 days of exposure, they were all on their way to recovery. While doctors usually prescribe antifungal medication for patients with severe histoplasmosis, many cases in healthy individuals go away on their own. Histoplasmosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose. As such, the researchers urge clinicians to ""consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis,"" they concluded. In collaboration with the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Ministry of Health, the CDC hopes to see the risk of histoplasmosis included in the Venado Caves tour waiver forms. It's not surprising that The Last of Us is so popular. After all, Andrzej Sapkowski-author of The Witcher-wrote that ""there's a grain of truth in every fairy tale."" That seems to hold true, even in a fungal zombie apocalypse."

Have a question? Send it to Jessica and Rich here. It's anonymous! Dear How to Do It, I am a gay man, and discovered a Fleshlight in my husband's underwear drawer while I was putting some of his clothes away a few days ago. When I confronted him about it, he said a (female) friend of his gave it to him as a joke for April Fool's Day, and he just wanted to ""try it out."" We have an active and fulfilling sex life (or at least I thought). Do I have reason to be concerned that I may not be enough for him, or worse, that he may have needs I can't satisfy? -Are We Still Playing on the Same Team? Dear Team, The implications of your question trouble me. Do you think your husband is not entitled to self-pleasure? Would you be similarly offended to learn that he uses his ... hand to masturbate? How much control over his sexuality do you think you're entitled to? You're gay, so surely you're aware of the widespread practice of open relationships within your tribe, right? Plenty of relationships survive not only their constituent partners masturbating, but partners having sex with other people, sometimes in large group settings. That's enough to make a Fleshlight look about as threatening to a relationship as a flashlight. People seek pleasure from sources other than their primary partner for a number of reasons. Yeah, it may have something to do with dissatisfaction, but it just as easily might not. If you are indeed in a monogamous relationship, and I assume so given your reaction to your husband having sex with an inanimate object, maybe all he wants is some variety. People like novelty, and masturbating, even with a toy, is a way to experience it. You are better off going with your gut and what your husband tells you. If you think your sex life is active and fulfilling, it probably is. Unless you are oblivious to signs, you would know if there were an issue. Your husband likely has a healthy libido and an adventurous mind. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Even if he has needs that you don't satisfy, that's still OK. It seems that you do satisfy plenty already. No one can be everything. In the future, instead of confronting your husband over something that intimidates you sexually, you should express curiosity. What does he like about that object and why? Is there anything he'd like to try that the two of you aren't doing? If you went as far as to ask him to incorporate the Fleshlight in your sex life, you'd be showing him the kind of acceptance that will likely make him comfortable communicating about such things. That could take the mystery out of the situation and make it so you don't have to wonder if you should be concerned or whether you're fulfilling his needs. Get sex advice-submit a question!

Dear How to Do It, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential-please include if you're open to How to Do It following up) Submit Dear How to Do It, My husband, ""Mike,"" spent years fantasizing about a threesome with us and another woman. About six months ago, we met ""Rachel"" while we were out at a nightclub, and we really hit it off with her. Once, when the three of us were having some drinks at a party, my husband confessed his fantasy. Rachel is the adventurous type and said to say the word if we ever wanted to make Mike's dream a reality. Advertisement Advertisement Mike's birthday was nearly a month ago, and Rachel and I decided the threesome would be the perfect surprise. The trouble was, when the moment came, Mike COULD NOT get it up, which is completely unusual for him. No matter what we tried, he remained a limp noodle. Needless to say, everyone ended up sorely disappointed. But that isn't the worst of it. Ever since then, my husband hasn't been able to achieve an erection. I've suggested going to see a urologist, but Mike is so embarrassed and depressed that he refuses. Now I'm scared we'll never have sex again! Help! -Mike's Lost His Magic Dear Mike's Lost His Magic, Advertisement Maybe you start by letting Mike know that what he experienced is not uncommon at all. For as much as he wanted the threesome, and as much pleasure as it seemed to promise, years of fantasizing were leading up to that moment. That alone can make for a pressurized situation that promotes performance anxiety. Possibly compounding the situation was that you sprung it on him. You and Rachel had the best intentions for doing so and reason to assume that it would go in a mutually satisfying direction, but it didn't. Anxiety, period, is a huge boner killer, and one can get stuck in a cycle of worrying about not getting hard, not being hard, and then worrying more about how it's coming across. It can be difficult to break that cycle, no matter how hot the situation or even how affirming one's partners are. It certainly helps when the partner(s) don't buy into the anxiety or pressure, but there's no guarantee that shrugging it off will actually help. Expressions of ""sore"" disappointment, though, almost certainly make an already fraught situation worse. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Erectile dysfunction drugs, in addition to opening up vessels and getting the blood flowing, can work as anti-anxiety meds. Knowing you have a little bit of extra lift can abate some of that nervousness and make it easier to perform. It might be that your husband doesn't have much experience with PDE5 inhibitors since you report that his limpness during your failed threesome was ""completely unusual for him."" (Granted, he may have discreetly popped a Viagra or Cialis in the past that you weren't aware of.) If he has no experience with these drugs, he should get a prescription-they could be a game changer, and they're easy enough to obtain online with minimal provider contact. I don't necessarily condone having minimal contact with a provider, but it's clear that a lot of guys are embarrassed about this stuff, and don't like visiting the doctor regardless of the issue, so telehealth companies like Hims and Ro are taking a lot of the discomfort out of the process. Yeah, going to a urologist could help Mike-what you describe sounds like a circumstantial ED issue that has psychological roots, but hearing from a doctor that Mike isn't broken and this issue is fixable could make a big difference. Still, if the guy won't go, you can't make him. Maybe you wait it out a bit more, let the problem remain persistent, and Mike may drop his resistance to the doctor. For a non-medical intervention in the meantime, he could try a cock ring. It's not foolproof, but it may help. Advertisement Advertisement Send Us Your Questions About the Workplace!

Dear How to Do It, My sister has been complaining about her inability to find a decent guy and her lack of luck on the dating scene. I work in an adult entertainment shop, and decided to use my employee discount to get her a super-realistic dildo for her birthday last week. Instead of being grateful, she got angry and accused me of thinking she ""couldn't get a man."" Did I act incorrectly? -Stumped Sister Dear Stumped Sister, Sometimes people just want to be listened to. Your sister wasn't necessarily asking for a solution to her problem, just for your ear and compassion. It sounds like she is more on the emotional side, while you lean pragmatic. It makes a certain kind of sense that you bought her a sex toy, given her issues, and I'm sure you meant well. But you did this, by your own admission, because of her dating problems. She reacted emotionally, but a version of, ""You bought this for me because I couldn't get a man,"" is the truth. The gift may have, in fact, reminded her of her dating frustrations primarily, so much so that it didn't have a shot at ameliorating her sexual ones-if she even has those! She may not be having issues finding sex, or she may already have sex toys she uses and likes, rendering the potential usefulness of your gift moot. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement If you don't have the kind of relationship where you talk about sex and/or masturbation in any detail, and if you've never gifted her with a sex toy before, she probably found the dildo inappropriate. It's really never a safe bet to give someone a sex toy, unless you're intimately involved with them and know they like them. Did you act incorrectly? Well, kinda. I think your intentions were pure, but not necessarily well thought out, and when it comes to giving gifts, it really is the thought that counts. -Rich More Advice From Slate I am 34 years old and have not had sex since I got sober 10 years ago. I also haven't been on a date. My life has pretty much been surrounded by doctors and hospitals as I learn to cope with chronic illness. But I'm at a point now where I'd like to date and maybe have sex again. But I don't know where to start. I'm submissive, and this might sound weird, but the absolute most important thing is they have to smell ""right."""

You can listen to episodes here. Science has pretty well established that the brain isn't static; it changes and adapts throughout our lives in response to life events in a process called neuroplasticity. Researchers are discovering this is especially true of female brains, which get remodeled significantly during the three Ps: puberty (as do the brains of adolescent males), pregnancy and perimenopause. All three transitions are a frequent butt of pop-culture jokes: the sulky, risk-taking teenager who only wants to be with friends; the scattered mom-to-be who leaves her cell phone in the fridge and can't remember where she parked the car; and the hormonal middle-aged woman who can't focus and spontaneously combusts with hot flashes. But far from being laughable, these behavioral stereotypes are the external manifestations of big internal shifts, many of them linked to the effects of fluctuating hormones on the brain. Cognitive neuroscientist Laura Pritschet, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, is fascinated by how female hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, affect the brain's organization and functioning. ""The reason I chose that field is because I was a budding neuroscientist as an undergrad, interested in brain networks and obsessing over how intricate everything was in the brain to simply allow us to have a personality or remember things,"" Pritschet told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life. ""At the same time in my personal life, I was surrounded by menopausal women who were talking about their cognitive complaints and their attention issues,"" she said. ""I thought we've got to connect these two together and understand this more."" Pritschet even volunteered as a ""guinea pig"" during graduate school, having her brain scanned and blood drawn for 30 days, across two complete reproductive cycles (both on and off birth control pills), to begin to answer the question of how the day-to-day fluctuations in hormones relate to the day-to-day changes in the brain. Around this time, other researchers were studying what happens in the brain during pregnancy, Pritschet said, looking at the brain before and after gestation. They found many changes, but because the studies took a snapshot approach, many questions were left unanswered. ""If there's a 3 to 5% decrease in total gray matter volume, when is that occurring (during pregnancy), and how is it occurring?"" Pritschet asked. ""We're missing huge gaps in what we call this metamorphosis. ""We know that the 40-week gestational window leads to these body adaptations to support the development of the fetus: We have increased plasma volume, immune function change, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption,"" she said. ""What does this trajectory look like over gestation?"" To find out, Pritschet and her team tracked the brain changes in one woman, using MRI and blood draws, from pre-conception and fertility treatment throughout her pregnancy to two years postpartum. Their findings were published in the journal Nature Neuroscience in September. You can listen to the full episode here. ""We saw this reduction in gray matter volume pretty much across the whole brain,"" Pritschet explained. ""We saw increased white matter microstructure and ventricle size."" (Quick anatomy lesson: The brain is made up of gray and white matter. Gray matter is where most of the brain's thinking and processing takes place. White matter helps connect the different brain areas, allowing them to communicate with one another.) ""The inflection point was birth,"" Pritschet said. ""We saw that those reductions persisted into postpartum, with slight recovery, meaning that certain areas of the brain showed this rise in gray matter volume in early postpartum. Others did not."" Pritschet said this ""choreographed dance between major features of our brain"" is in one respect a physical adaptation to the increased blood flow and swelling that comes with pregnancy. Additionally, the changes may also be a preparation for the next stage: parenting. ""It's a fine-tuning of circuits,"" she explained. ""We know that pregnancy is the lead-up to this time in your life where there's a lot of behavioral adaptation that has to occur, and new cognitive demands, and a new cognitive load. ""And so the idea here is that there is this pruning or this delicate rewiring to make certain networks or to make communication in the brain more efficient to meet the demands that are going to have to occur,"" Pritschet said. This theory is supported by earlier work. ""The first pinnacle papers that came out looking at neuroanatomy in human women from preconception to postpartum found that degree of change in gray matter volume - that sort of reduction - correlated with various ... maternal behaviors (such as bonding). Again, that's all correlation,"" she said. ""That's an area we need to do a lot more research on, and it needs a lot of context,"" she said. ""But you can expect that if there's fine-tuning in these circuits that underlie cognitive or behavioral process, that the more fine-tuning it undergoes, the better performance you're going to have. That's the idea - but it's so much more complicated than that."" What happens to the brain during pregnancy? Pritschet offers these three insights. The only constant is change The body is the outward sign of a lot of inner upheaval. ""Pregnancy is a transformative time in a person's life where the body undergoes rapid physiological adaptations to prepare for motherhood,"" Pritschet said via email. ""But pregnancy doesn't just transform the body - it also triggers profound change to the brain and reflects another critical period of brain development."" She called this remodeling an often-overlooked period of brain development that takes place well into a woman's adulthood. How alarmed should women be? Less gray matter may not sound very positive, but it happens for a reason. ""Despite what one might think, these reductions are not a bad thing, and in fact, are to be expected,"" Pritschet said, noting that some of the losses are eventually regained. ""This change could indicate a fine-tuning' of brain circuits, not unlike what happens to all young adults as they transition through puberty and their brain becomes more specialized."" These changes could also be a response to the high physiological demands of pregnancy itself, she said, ""showcasing just how adaptive the brain can be."" These changes could affect future health and behavior Mapping these changes could open the door to understanding an array of other neurological and behavioral outcomes including postpartum depression, headaches, migraines, epilepsy, stroke and parental behavior. ""The neuroanatomical changes that unfold during (pregnancy) have broad implications for understanding vulnerability to mental health disorders ... and individual differences in parental behavior,"" said Pritschet. It may even provide critical insight into how the brain changes over a lifespan, she said. We hope these insights help you better understand the brain changes that occur during pregnancy.

Loneliness was closely tied to a cluster of defensive symptoms-pain, fatigue, and low mood-which were especially severe among the poor. The study found that social connection helped reduce these symptoms, but the protective effects were strongest for those living in poverty. These findings suggest that social relationships are crucial to buffering the health impacts of economic disadvantage and highlight the need for targeted community support in low-income populations. Key Facts: Income-Loneliness Gap: 49% of low-income individuals felt lonely vs. 15% of high-income peers. 49% of low-income individuals felt lonely vs. 15% of high-income peers. Health Toll: Lonely people in poverty showed the highest levels of pain, fatigue, and low mood. Lonely people in poverty showed the highest levels of pain, fatigue, and low mood. Social Buffering: Strong relationships most effectively reduced symptoms in the poorest groups. Source: Oxford University A new study from the University of Oxford, published in Public Health, shows that European people in the lowest income deciles are much more likely to feel lonely than those in the highest income deciles, despite no difference in how often they socialise. Furthermore, both poverty and loneliness were strongly associated with higher scores on a defensive symptom cluster characterised by elevated levels of pain, fatigue and low mood. The study also showed that the symptom-reducing effects of social connection were strongest for people living in poverty. The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status. Credit: Neuroscience News These findings have important implications for social, economic, and health policy, suggesting that strong social relationships may serve as important buffers against some of the health consequences of poverty. The defensive symptom cluster refers to set of frequently co-occurring and mutually reinforcing symptoms that, understood from an evolutionary perspective, represent the body's response to danger and scarcity. Humans evolved in groups which provided access to resources and protection from danger; when we feel socially excluded or isolated our bodies respond with a set of symptoms that are meant to protect us, for example pain helps protect us from injury, and fatigue and low mood may help us conserve energy. Researchers, led by Dr Arran Davis of the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, examined data from a survey of 24,505 respondents across 20 European countries. Key findings include: People in the lowest income decile were much likely to report feeling lonely in the last week than people in the highest income decile; 49% compared to just 15%. This is despite there being no difference in the amount of time people in different income deciles reported socialising with family, friends, and colleagues. People who report feeling lonely have, on average, higher scores on the symptom cluster. The average lonely person has a symptom cluster score that is higher than 67% of not lonely people. However, the difference in the average symptom cluster score between lonely people and not lonely people is significantly larger in the lowest income decile than the highest income decile. The average lonely person in the lowest income decile has a symptom cluster score higher than 73% of non-lonely people in the same income decile. In the highest income decile, the average lonely person has a higher symptom cluster score than 65% of non-lonely people. 30% of lonely individuals from the lowest income decile had high symptom cluster scores compared with just 2% of non-lonely people in the highest income decile, suggesting that social relationships play a particularly important role in influencing the health outcomes of people living in poverty. The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status. Past research has identified supportive social relationships as buffers to the negative effects of poverty. The findings from this study suggest that as material resources decrease the importance of social resources increase, with those who are both in poverty and lonely displaying the highest symptom cluster scores. Lead author, evolutionary anthropologist, Dr Arran Davis said: ""The relationship between poverty and poor health is well established, and previous research suggests that loneliness may be as bad for you as smoking. ""Our study shows that for people who are both on low incomes and lonely the health costs are particularly marked. I hope this study inspires more research into the factors that lead people to feel socially disconnected and to the development of policies that support strong communities in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.""

""Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood"" by Arran Davis et al. Public Health Abstract Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood Objective Perceived social isolation is associated with increased pain, fatigue, and depression. Other research has shown that pain and depression are more common in individuals experiencing low socio-economic status, and that social relationships are especially important for buffering the negative health effects of low socio-economic status. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods We used a 20-country, cross-sectional sample of 24,504 respondents to the European Social Survey 7. Multilevel linear regression was used to test for the effects of loneliness, income decile, and their interaction on a symptom cluster variable that was the average of respondent z-scores on self-reported pain, fatigue, and low mood. We hypothesised that loneliness and low income would be interactively associated with higher symptom cluster scores. Results Those from lower income deciles were much more likely to feel lonely (48.7 % in the lowest income decile; 15.2 % in the highest income decile), despite no differences in reported time spent socialising. Multilevel linear regression indicated statistically significant associations consistent with our hypotheses: (1) lonely individuals score 0.447 SD higher on the symptom cluster, (2) for every increase in income decile, symptom cluster scores decrease by 0.022 SD, and (3) a loneliness by income interaction on the symptom cluster (b = 0.018), with the association between loneliness and the symptom cluster being strongest amongst those in lower income deciles. Conclusions Both loneliness and low income were associated with higher scores on the symptom cluster, and social relationships were especially strong buffers of the symptom cluster for individuals experiencing poverty. Results inform understandings of social and economic gradients in health."

Let's start with the basics: Menopause is officially diagnosed when a person hasn't had a menstrual cycle for 12 months. Leading up to that is perimenopause, a transitional period when reproductive hormones, particularly estrogen, begin to drop. That hormonal shift is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with menopause, including the ones that can mess with your mouth. To understand what's going on, I spoke to two experts (a gynecologist and a dentist) who broke down how menopause affects your teeth and gums, plus what you can do to stay ahead of it. How does menopause affect your oral health? Estrogen plays a major role in maintaining the health of your oral tissues. When levels drop, your mouth can feel the impact. ""During menopause, the decline in estrogen can lead to significant changes in the oral cavity, including dry mouth (xerostomia), burning tongue (glossodynia), increased gum sensitivity and changes in taste,"" says Dr. Somi Javaid, a board-certified OB/GYN and founder of HerMD. Hormonal shifts can also raise your risk of gum inflammation, gingivitis and periodontal disease. Saliva production is another issue. ""Saliva is essential for neutralizing acids, washing away bacteria and preventing tooth decay,"" says Dr. Pia Lieb, a cosmetic dentist at Cosmetic Dentistry Center NYC. ""Without enough saliva, you're more vulnerable to cavities, infections, and even trouble speaking or swallowing."" Menopause can also increase your risk of osteoporosis, which can affect the jawbone and potentially lead to tooth loss or complications with dental implants. How to protect your teeth during menopause Now for the good news: You don't have to kiss the health of your teeth goodbye just because you're in perimenopause or menopause. According to our experts, you can do several things to prevent declining oral health during this time of life. Below, some of the most effective tactics: Practice good oral hygiene: ""Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, and use alcohol-free mouthwash,"" says Lieb. Regular flossing is also crucial, adds Javaid.Stay hydrated: If dry mouth is an issue, increase your water intake, says Lieb. ""You can also use saliva substitutes to keep your mouth hydrated."" Go to the dentist regularly: ""Regular checkups and cleanings become even more critical during and after menopause,"" says Lieb. Plus, routine deep cleanings will prevent plaque buildup. Early detection and intervention can mitigate the progression of oral health complications associated with menopause,"" says Javaid.Talk to your doctor: Make an appointment with your gynecologist to discuss overall treatments for menopause that may be suitable for you. ""Hormone therapy (HT) may be beneficial for many women, particularly when oral symptoms are part of a broader systemic hormonal deficiency,"" says Javaid. ""A comprehensive evaluation is essential to tailor treatment to the patient's needs.""

Researchers analyzed DNA methylation, a cellular marker of aging, in men aged 50 to 72 who followed a nutrient-rich, plant-forward lifestyle. Those who consumed more methyl adaptogen foods showed significantly greater reductions in epigenetic age, even after adjusting for weight changes and starting biological age. These results reinforce the idea that specific dietary choices can meaningfully impact how we age at the molecular level. Key Facts: Epigenetic Aging: Measured through DNA methylation, epigenetic age reflects biological, not chronological, aging. Methyl Adaptogens: Foods like garlic, green tea, turmeric, and berries were linked to slower cellular aging. Foods like garlic, green tea, turmeric, and berries were linked to slower cellular aging. Lasting Effects: Benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight and initial age differences. Source: Impact Journals A new research paper was published in Aging, titled ""Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study."" In this study, researchers led by first author Jamie L. Villanueva from the University of Washington and the National University of Natural Medicine, along with corresponding author Ryan Bradley from the National University of Natural Medicine and University of California, investigated how diet influences epigenetic aging. These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits. Credit: Neuroscience News They found that certain plant-based foods containing natural compounds called methyl adaptogens were associated with a decrease in epigenetic age. This effect was measured using DNA methylation, a marker that reflects how the body ages at the cellular level. The findings suggest that targeted food choices may help slow the aging process. Epigenetic age refers to how old a person's cells appear biologically, rather than their actual age in years. DNA methylation patterns, which are chemical tags on DNA, can indicate whether someone is aging faster or slower than expected. For this study, researchers used Horvath's epigenetic clock, a widely accepted tool, to measure changes in epigenetic age. The analysis included healthy men aged 50 to 72 who had previously completed an eight-week program featuring a plant-based, nutrient-rich diet, along with guidance on exercise, sleep, and stress management. Researchers focused on individual dietary differences to understand why some participants experienced greater improvements in epigenetic age than others. The study found that those who ate higher amounts of methyl adaptogen foods-including turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries, green tea, and oolong tea-experienced greater reductions in epigenetic age. These benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight changes and participants' starting epigenetic age, suggesting that the foods themselves had a direct impact on aging markers. ""In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes."" The natural compounds in methyl adaptogen foods are known to influence how genes behave by affecting DNA methylation. Previous studies have shown that these compounds may support healthy aging and help lower the risk of conditions such as heart disease and cognitive decline. While this study involved a relatively small group of middle-aged men, it adds knowledge to growing global research showing that diets rich in polyphenols-found in vegetables, fruits, and teas-are associated with slower aging. These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits. Future research should include larger and more diverse populations and use updated epigenetic aging tools to confirm these results. Based on current evidence, this study highlights a practical, food-based strategy that may help reduce epigenetic aging and support long-term health.

""Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study"" by Ryan Bradley et al. Aging Abstract Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study Background: Aging is the primary risk factor for developing non-communicable chronic diseases, necessitating interventions targeting the aging process. Outcome measures of biological aging used in these interventions are mathematical algorithms applied to DNA methylation patterns, known as epigenetic clocks. The Methylation Diet and Lifestyle study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of a diet and lifestyle intervention that utilized epigenetic age as its primary outcome, measured using Horvath's clock. Significant reductions in epigenetic age post-intervention were observed but with notable variability. Purpose: This research aimed to identify dietary components associated with epigenetic age change across groups. Contributing factors to variability, such as weight changes and baseline differences in chronological and epigenetic age, were explored. Results: In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes. Although the intervention group lost significantly more weight than the control group, these changes were not associated with epigenetic age changes in the regression model. These findings suggest that consuming foods categorized as methyl adaptogens may reduce markers of epigenetic aging."

From ancient Egyptian remedies involving dates, dog's paws, and donkey hooves, to Celtic rituals with mice, people have long sought a dependable cure for balding. Native American tribes even relied on yucca juice, hoping it would restore their hair. Yet, despite centuries of effort, a universal and effective treatment has remained elusive. Now, a scientific breakthrough from researchers at UCLA might change that story. Scientists there recently unveiled promising results from their decade-long effort, focusing on a new molecule known as PP405. This tiny molecule could soon revolutionize how you deal with hair loss. Understanding Hair Loss Losing hair is surprisingly common. By age 50, over half of men and a quarter of women experience some form of noticeable hair thinning. Causes vary widely-from aging and genetics to stress, hormone issues, and even chemotherapy or illness. Despite being a common condition, effective treatments have been limited. Only two FDA-approved medications, minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia), exist today. But even these are effective in just about one-third of patients. (CREDIT: CC BY-SA 4.0) ""They are both limited in efficacy and improve hair in only a portion of patients who take them,"" explains William Lowry, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCLA's Broad Stem Cell Research Center. Other options, such as supplements, red light therapy, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, and hair transplants, lack definitive evidence and often come with high costs and limited success rates. None provide permanent or comprehensive restoration. The New Scientific Frontier UCLA scientists, including Lowry, Heather Christofk, professor of biological chemistry, and Michael Jung, distinguished professor of chemistry, have been focusing on a new approach. Their research pinpointed PP405, a molecule designed to awaken dormant but healthy hair follicles. Instead of stimulating weak growth typical of existing treatments, PP405 encourages the growth of robust, terminal hair-the thick, visible type people want most. Lowry's team discovered a unique metabolic pathway in hair follicle stem cells. When activated by PP405, these dormant cells rapidly start producing new hairs. In a 2023 clinical trial in Orange County, researchers found significant success applying PP405 topically to the scalp each night for just one week. The researchers labeled their initial results ""statistically significant,"" highlighting the strength and reliability of their findings. Lowry described the discovery process clearly: ""We found that promoting this metabolism can accelerate stem cell activation, which makes new hairs grow. We subsequently developed drugs that can drive this effect."" From Discovery to Market Despite initial fears that PP405 might harm follicles, tests showed it safely promotes hair growth without damaging existing follicles. Encouraged by these results, UCLA's Technology Transfer Group facilitated the creation of Pelage Pharmaceuticals, a new company specifically aimed at commercializing PP405. With support from Google Ventures, Pelage Pharmaceuticals secured $16.4 million last year to conduct further trials and navigate the extensive FDA approval process. ""FDA approvals always take some time, as they should,"" Lowry noted. ""But it will be worth waiting for."" Lowry also cautioned optimism with realism, stressing, ""No such product will work for everyone. But our first human trials in Orange County have been very encouraging, and larger trials with more people will follow."" Growing Market and Social Impact Hair loss affects more than just appearance-it impacts psychological and emotional well-being. Dermatologist Brendan Camp, practicing in Manhattan, highlights this emotional toll, describing hair loss as ""a condition that affects many and can have a negative impact on people's psychosocial health."" This emotional burden drives continued interest in effective treatments. The demand for reliable solutions has increased, paralleling the popularity of cosmetic treatments such as Botox and fillers. Dermatologist Amy Spizuoco from True Dermatology in New York refers to hair-loss treatments as the ""new Botox,"" highlighting how proactive measures are becoming mainstream. Arms and interventions of the original clinical study. (CREDIT: Clinicaltrials.gov) ""Much like Botox is used preventatively, younger people are tackling hair loss at the first signs rather than waiting until it's severe,"" Spizuoco explained. This shift toward preventative and early intervention strategies has sparked growth in specialized hair-loss clinics across the country. Patients today are more likely to seek help sooner, benefiting from modern treatments like PRP injections, advanced medications, and now potentially groundbreaking options like PP405. Moving Forward Experts recommend starting with established treatments such as minoxidil, finasteride, or spironolactone (for women) before exploring newer options. Camp suggests patients test these medications for three to four months, typically the period required to assess their effectiveness. ""When looking for a treatment, stick to those with a well-established body of evidence and data to support their use,"" Camp advised. He further emphasized seeking advice from board-certified dermatologists to maximize effectiveness and safety. Primary outcome measures of the original study. (CREDIT: Clinicaltrials.gov) While hair loss remains common, timely action can significantly slow or even reverse it, especially with promising advances like PP405. As research progresses, there is genuine optimism that a more universally effective treatment is within reach. ""We are excited about the opportunity to bring a novel treatment option to patients with hair loss based on strong science and rigorous clinical trials,"" Lowry concluded. ""Additionally, because the mechanism of action we discovered is distinct from previous approaches, it can potentially be used in combination with other therapies."" Thanks to UCLA's promising discovery, your future might soon involve less worrying about thinning hair and more confidence in lasting results.

Source: UCLA As researchers work to improve treatment of Alzheimer's disease, new research by UCLA Health identified a candidate drug that reduces levels of a toxic form of a protein in the brain caused by the disease and improved memory in mice by boosting production of a protective protein. In a study published in the Nature journal npj Drug Discovery, UCLA Health researchers targeted the protein clusterin (CLU), which is crucial in preventing the build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins that that disrupt communication between brain cells and lead to memory impairment - a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Credit: Neuroscience News More than a decade ago, a variant of the gene that encodes clusterin was identified as the third strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. It was recently reported that increased CLU protein could provide protection against Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline. UCLA Health researchers led by Varghese John identified a candidate small molecule, DDL-357, that increased concentrations of secreted clusterin (sCLU) in Alzheimer's mouse models, resulting in a reduction of the toxic protein phospho-tau and improvement of mitochondrial function, both associated with progression of the disease. DDL-357 also improved the memory of treated mice in maze-based cognitive tests. ""Our findings open the door to the development of new treatments that not only target the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease but also restore lost cognitive function - something that existing therapies have yet to achieve,"" said John, a professor of neurology and director of the Drug Discovery Laboratory (DDL) at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research and Care at UCLA. ""While the drug candidate is still in pre-clinical testing and far from human trials, initial results suggest it could work in concert with existing Alzheimer's disease treatments and may also be effective in treating other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"", John said. The drug is one of the latest that John and fellow UCLA Health researchers at the Drug Discovery Laboratory have identified as potential candidates for development to treat Alzheimer's disease. One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer's model mice by jumpstarting the brain's memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory.

""Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer's disease mice"" by Varghese John et al. npj Drug Discovery Abstract Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer's disease mice Despite substantial research and drug discovery efforts, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. A mutation in the clusterin (CLU) gene that hinders expression of the cyto-protective secreted isoform of clusterin (sCLU) that affects the aggregation and clearance of two key proteins implicated in AD, A and tau, is the third most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Here, we present findings from our drug discovery program to identify small molecules that enhance sCLU levels and assess their impact on AD pathology and cognition in a murine model of AD. A high-throughput screening campaign identified two classes of epigenetic modulators that increase sCLU levels with subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts leading to bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor new chemical entities (NCEs) with enhanced potency, drug-like properties, and oral brain bioavailability. The lead candidate NCE, DDL-357, increased brain sCLU in the murine ApoE4TR-5XFAD model of AD in a subchronic study. In a follow-up chronic study in the murine 3xTg-AD model, DDL-357 reduced phospho-tau in brain and led to improvements in mouse performance and memory in the Barnes maze testing paradigm. Proteomic analysis of brain tissue from both AD models revealed changes in proteins involved in mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity. These findings reveal the potential of sCLU enhancement as a target for therapeutic development in AD and support the continued development of the preclinical lead candidate."

Hormonal birth control can be used for more than just preventing pregnancy - it's also a popular way to go months or even years without a period. Continuous use birth control involves taking hormonal pills without what's called a placebo week or using other methods such as an implant, ring or injections without a break. This method can end the regular bleeding associated with periods, as well as the cramps, migraines and other symptoms of menstruation. As social media becomes a hotbed for amateur medical advice and personal anecdotes, posts about getting off the pill and preventing pregnancy through nonhormonal methods rake in thousands of views daily on apps like TikTok. As influencers share their fears about infertility and the possible harms of suppressing your body's natural processes, reproductive experts say myths and misinformation about hormonal birth control are on the rise. To understand more about the risks, rewards and science behind using birth control to forego menstruation, I had a chat with reproductive health expert Dr. Kavita Nanda. As an obstetrician-gynecologist and clinical researcher for the North Carolina-based human development nonprofit FHI 360, Nanda has spent over 25 years studying continuous use birth control and other forms of contraception. This conversation has been condensed for length and clarity. CNN: How does hormonal birth control work? Dr. Kavita Nanda: Combined contraceptives use synthetic forms of estrogen and progesterone together. Combination methods work to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovaries. Other methods use synthetic progesterone only, including pills, implants, injectables and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Both combined and progestin-only methods make the mucus in your cervix thicker, which makes it hard for sperm to enter the uterus, and the lining of your uterus also remains thin. CNN: What is continuous use? And how does it differ from other methods? Nanda: The standard way to take combined contraceptives is cyclically, every day for three weeks, and then you have a break in the hormones for a week. You either don't take a pill, or you take a placebo for a week, so you have what's called a withdrawal bleed. The lining of the uterus sheds, and that's what people call a ""period,"" although it's really just a hormone-free withdrawal bleed. But when we talk about continuous use, you don't take any breaks. The uterine lining stays thin and intact, and this means that users can go weeks, months or even longer, without a ""period."" CNN: How long can you safely go without a monthly bleed? Nanda: There have been studies comparing continuous versus cyclical use, and it's just as effective and just as safe. There's no medical reason to have a period or withdrawal bleed when you're on hormonal contraceptives. As long as you don't have any contraindications (medical conditions) for the birth control pill, you don't have contraindications for the continuous use of the pill. Historically, before contraception, women didn't necessarily bleed all the time, because a lot of time was spent either being pregnant or breastfeeding. In both of those conditions, there's no monthly bleeding, often for months. Now, if you're not pregnant or breastfeeding, you're not on hormonal contraception, and you don't have a monthly period - that's something you do need to discuss with your provider, because that could signal an issue. CNN: Are there any side effects specific to continuous use? Nanda: The side effects in general are similar to those with cyclical use. For example, you might have nausea, breast tenderness and headaches (at any time). With continuous use, some people experience unexpected breakthrough bleeding or spotting, especially initially, but this usually improves over time, and many people do achieve amenorrhea or (the) cessation of menses. For some people, it may take three to four months. CNN: How does continuous use affect fertility after stopping? Nanda: There's no evidence that long-term use of hormonal contraception - whether it's combined hormonal interception, taken continuously or cyclically - causes infertility, and fertility typically returns within a month or two. Basically, once you stop, the (synthetic) hormones go away very quickly from the blood, ovulation is no longer suppressed, your normal estrogen and progesterone production resume. Assuming that you had normal menstrual cycles before, they would resume. (One exception is) if you're taking something like the Depo Provera contraceptive injection. It doesn't cause infertility, but it may take longer for fertility to return after injections. CNN: Why were placebo pills invented if there's no harm in skipping them? Nanda: When the combined oral contraceptive pill was developed in the 1950s, the now-standard 21 days of active pills followed by a seven-day hormone-free interval was not based on medical necessity, but rather on cultural and strategic reasons. At the time, there was a widely held belief that menstruating every 28 days was a sign of normal female reproductive function. To align with that expectation, the regimen was designed to mimic a natural menstrual cycle, with a monthly withdrawal bleed intended to reassure both users and physicians that they were not pregnant - important in an era before home pregnancy tests were readily available - and, at the time, to help ease religious and societal resistance to contraception. CNN: Who may consider continuous use birth control? Nanda: It's really a personal preference and a discussion between a person and their provider. Someone might not want to have a period for years, or some people prefer to bleed three times a year. Some people feel reassured by monthly bleeding. Continuous use may be especially helpful for people who have painful periods, heavy periods, endometriosis, migraines, iron-deficiency anemia, physical or intellectual disabilities, and transgender individuals."

This rare but severe disorder, marked by hallucinations, paranoia, and disorganized thinking after childbirth, can have life-threatening consequences if not treated. The findings highlight a strong familial risk, particularly when bipolar disorder is also present, underscoring the need for early screening and increased awareness. While the relative risk is high, the actual risk remains low, at 1.6%, but understanding family history could allow for preventive interventions and targeted mental health support during the vulnerable postpartum period. Key Facts: High Familial Risk: Having a sister with postpartum psychosis raises a woman's risk more than tenfold. Having a sister with postpartum psychosis raises a woman's risk more than tenfold. Bipolar Link: The risk increases to 14x if the sister also has bipolar disorder. The risk increases to 14x if the sister also has bipolar disorder. Call for Awareness: Despite its severity, postpartum psychosis remains understudied and underdiagnosed. Source: Mount Sinai Hospital Mount Sinai researchers have found for the first time that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had experienced the condition, compared to a woman with a sister who did not. The findings, which were published May 19 in the American Journal of Psychiatry and highlighted at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting press briefing the same day, suggest both genetic and shared environmental influences. Postpartum psychosis is a rare but serious mental illness that leaves a devastating impact on mothers in the vulnerable weeks and months after childbirth. It carries increased risk of suicide and infanticide if left untreated. Among the early warning signs of postpartum psychosis are severe mood swings, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, insomnia, paranoia, and thoughts of self-harm. Despite the devastating ramifications of the disorder, it remains vastly understudied and a challenge for physicians to diagnose and address. ""Every woman of childbearing age and their physicians need to know about the existence of, severity, symptoms, and familial risk for postpartum psychosis so it can be promptly diagnosed and, hopefully, prevented,"" said Veerle Bergink, MD, PhD, Director of the Women's Mental Health Center at Mount Sinai and co-senior author of the paper. ""At present, too many women at higher risk don't know it and are left on their own with a new baby and no support. We hope these study findings will help move the needle and impart change. ""With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, we can implement changes to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period."" The Mount Sinai study team examined the records of more than 1.6 million women from the Swedish nationwide registries, identifying 2,514 women who had experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first childbirth. In addition to finding that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had the condition, the Swedish registry study showed that the presence of bipolar disorder in a sister doubles the woman's risk of developing postpartum psychosis. Women with a sister who has bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis were shown to be at highest risk; their risk for developing postpartum psychosis themselves is 14 times increased. The study measured relative recurrent risk for the disorder, which implies increased likelihood of its appearance in another member of the family. This differs from actual risk, which refers to the probability of developing the condition. Researchers learned that while the relative risk of postpartum psychosis is quite high in full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sister is still low at 1.6 percent. ""These findings support the view that even though there is overlap between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder, these are in fact, distinct conditions,"" said Dr. Bergink. ""We hope this new data will help move the needle and impart change. With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, measures can and should be taken to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period."" Beyond expanding awareness around postpartum psychosis, this study provides a solid foundation for the next step of research, aimed at early recognition and prevention. Work that involves identifying the genes responsible for this disease is already underway at Mount Sinai in the lab of Behrang Mahjani, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-author of the study. ""We're using complex molecular data to investigate the genetic architecture of the disease,"" says Dr. Mahjani. ""Knowing what specific genes are involved will help us dive into the mechanisms and triggers of postpartum psychosis, and if they're hormone- or immune-related. And that, in turn, could lead us to novel treatments and ways to proactively inform women of their risk before they're faced with a severe health crisis.""

""Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis"" by Veerle Bergink. American Journal of Psychiatry Abstract Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis Objective: Postpartum psychosis is one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks of suicide and infanticide if untreated. Although genetic factors contribute to the risk of postpartum psychosis, the extent of familial risk remains to be determined. The authors compared relative recurrence risk across different family relationship types, hypothesizing that relative recurrence risk for postpartum psychosis varies by degree of genetic relatedness and is higher in female full siblings than in cousins. Methods: This cohort study consisted of 1,648,759 women from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,514 (0.15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within 3 months of their first-ever childbirth. The authors estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for female full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial risk. Results: The relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 10.69 (95% CI=6.60, 16.26) when adjusted for year of and age at childbirth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1.78, 95% CI=0.70, 3.62). Despite the higher familial risk of postpartum psychosis among full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sibling was relatively low, estimated at 1.60% within the entire population. Conclusions: The observed increased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings suggests both genetic and shared environmental influences. However, the lack of significant results in cousins hampers a more accurate distinction between these factors. Furthermore, despite increased relative recurrence risk in siblings, their overall likelihood of developing postpartum psychosis remains low. This study underscores the need for further research to better understand the intricate interplay of genetics and shared environment in the development of postpartum psychosis."

While he may have failed his first year of medical school, Rodriguez never abandoned his ambition to save lives. Today, he is leading a team that has discovered a weakness in the biological mechanisms driving metastasis, the process by which cancer spreads through the body-responsible for nearly 70 percent of cancer-related deaths. Turning the Immune System Against Metastases Rodriguez's research focuses on a specific group of cells in the immune system known as macrophages. Under normal conditions, these cells help protect the body by attacking harmful invaders. But in the presence of cancer, some macrophages undergo a transformation. According to Rodriguez, they begin to ""adopt a program that helps tumor cells migrate and invade new tissues,"" effectively becoming accomplices in the spread of cancer. This transformation is not just behavioral, but metabolic. The team discovered that these pro-tumor macrophages shift their internal processes in a way that supports cancer progression. This insight allowed Rodriguez and his colleagues to design a molecule that can interfere with that specific metabolic switch. By targeting these rogue macrophages, the molecule works to reverse their role in supporting metastasis without damaging other healthy immune cells. Ferroptosis diagram: Iron is internalized in the cell via the protein CD44 present on its surface, allowing it to acquire metastatic properties and tolerance to standard treatments through epigenetic reprogramming, which plays a key role in cell adaptation. The activation of lysosomal iron by a phospholipid degrader causes the oxidation and rupture of cell membranes, leading to cell death. Credit: Institut Curie A New Path in Cancer Treatment Rodriguez developed this molecule in collaboration with researchers across multiple disciplines, including chemistry, cell biology, and immunology. Preclinical trials using mice have shown that the molecule not only inhibits the macrophages' transformation but also slows the development of metastatic tumors. This multi-step approach opens a path toward treatments that don't just fight the primary tumor but stop cancer from spreading altogether. The implications of this work have attracted attention from major pharmaceutical groups and cancer research institutions worldwide. Rodriguez is now preparing for the next stage: bringing this molecule into clinical testing. Although that process is lengthy and complex, his results have already generated significant interest in the scientific community. His work is being closely followed, especially as the fight against metastasis remains one of the most pressing challenges in oncology. From his lab at Institut Curie, one of Europe's leading centers for cancer research, Rodriguez continues refining his approach. He works alongside a multidisciplinary team determined to turn the tide on one of cancer's most elusive and deadly traits."

Despite its prevalence, the condition remains poorly understood. But researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas have shed new light on it by linking it to a little-known nerve structure first described more than a century ago: the Nageotte nodule. In a study published this month in the journal Nature Communications, the team found that dorsal root ganglia - clusters of nerves near the spine that relay sensory signals like pain to the brain - were filled with these nodules in diabetic tissue donors. These microscopic bundles, showing signs of both nerve injury and jumbled regrowth, could offer fresh insight into what drives diabetic peripheral neuropathy and help reframe how scientists study and treat it, said Stephanie Eid, a research assistant professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School, who was not involved in the study. ""We are coming closer to understanding what's really happening in this disease that has been mysterious so far ... and hopefully a step closer to a cure,"" Eid said.

These changes can damage tiny blood vessels, increase inflammation and stress out the nerves' energy supply. Over time, that leads to injury and breakdown of the nerves, particularly in the legs and feet, and the protective cells that surround them. Advertisement Endocrinologist Dr. Howard Baum checks the insulin pump of patient Connie Hedgecoke of Garland during her quarterly diabetes checkup in his office at Medical City in Dallas. ((File Photo)) It often takes at least a decade after a diabetes diagnosis for noticeable symptoms to appear. These can include numbness, tingling pain and weakness. In more severe cases, particularly when high blood sugar is poorly controlled, complications can escalate to foot ulcers or even amputations of the lower limbs. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can also interfere with the body's sense of proprioception - its unconscious ability to detect where its limbs are - which increases a diabetic's risk of falls and injuries. Advertisement ""It's very common for people when they start to get diabetic neuropathy, that one of the first things that happens is problems with proprioception or balance,"" said Ted Price, a professor of neuroscience at UTD and director of its Center for Advanced Pain Studies, who led the study. ""Then they also tend to lose the sense of touch at the bottoms of their feet, and then sometime after that, they start to get pain."" Advertisement A century-old discovery sees new light Price didn't have diabetic peripheral neuropathy in mind when he and his colleagues began their research into the dorsal root ganglion in March 2020. At the time, they had launched a collaboration with the Southwest Transplant Alliance, a Dallas-based nonprofit, to build a nerve tissue bank. The project, part of a wider research effort led by the National Institutes of Health's Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative, aimed to better understand how pain is generated by nociceptors - pain-sensing nerve cells - in the dorsal root ganglion. ""That's the tissue that changes in people with peripheral neuropathies,"" Price said. ""Most people who have chronic pain have some kind of pathology within their dorsal root ganglion."" Advertisement Professors of neuroscience Ted Price (seated) and Greg Dussor in their lab at UTD in 2017. Both researchers were involved in the study. (Ben Torres/Special Contributor) While examining donor dorsal root ganglia in 2022, UTD researcher Stephanie Shiers kept noticing a curious structure: microscopic balls of dead sensory neurons ringed by satellite glial cells, a type of non-neuronal cell that supports neurons. ""When I started seeing these popping up, I went to the literature to try to figure out what they were,"" said Shiers, who is the study's first author. She eventually found papers describing similar structures in rhesus macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus, in rats intoxicated with mercury and in humans with a variety of neurological and neurodegenerative conditions. These structures were identified as Nageotte nodules, named for the French anatomist Jean Nageotte, who first described the formations in 1922 while grafting bundles of nerves from rabbit to rabbit. Advertisement Shiers then combed through the donors' medical records to look for patterns. One striking throughline emerged from samples of 90 dorsal root ganglia examined: Nageotte nodules were more common in the subset of tissue donors who had diabetes. Diabetics who appeared to have diabetic peripheral neuropathy, based on symptoms noted in their records, had more Nageotte nodules. Curious about what these nodules were made of, Shiers and her colleagues decided to investigate them at a molecular level with spatial sequencing, which shows which genes are active and where. The researchers found Nageotte nodules had both satellite glial cells and non-myelinating Schwann cells, another non-neuronal support cell. Together the two cell types seemed to be stepping in after nerve damage, clustering around the long-gone dead sensory neurons. Stephanie Shiers is a research scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas, where she completed her PhD in cognition and neuroscience in 2019. (University of Texas at Dallas) Advertisement Threaded through the nodules were axons, or long wirelike projections of nerve cells that transmit electrical signals from the body's extremities to the brain, much like data traveling through an ethernet cable. In diabetic peripheral neuropathy, loss of these axons is thought to cause much of the pain, numbness and tingling that diabetics experience. Inside the Nageotte nodules, Shiers and her colleagues saw the axons were trying to regrow but in a disorganized fashion - more like frayed electrical wires than a clean repair. This kind of jumbled regrowth is called a neuroma, said Price, and is commonly seen in people who have had a limb amputated. The hunt for treatments Shiers' chance discovery of Nageotte nodules and their link to diabetic peripheral neuropathy is the first step in research she and Price aim to conduct to better understand the condition and develop more effective treatments. Advertisement One major question they want to explore is whether the axons inside Nageotte nodules within the dorsal root ganglion are electrically active and, if so, whether they're sending pain signals to the brain. Some studies have found that electrically stimulating the dorsal root ganglion may be effective for managing chronic pain conditions like complex regional pain syndrome. But whether it will work for diabetic peripheral neuropathy requires further research. By studying the chemicals released by the different cells inside a Nageotte nodule, Price said, it might be possible to identify targets for drugs that stop whatever is causing pain signaling, whether it's inflammation or some other process causing damage. ""Those cells that form the nodule, they seem to be pathological in some way,"" Price said. ""I think maybe they could be a source of what's called reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species [that] we know are involved in diabetes and diabetic neuropathy. Advertisement ""My guess is that those pathological cells could be changed in some way with a therapeutic to not produce reactive oxygen or reactive nitrogen species and that could probably alleviate some of the pain-related symptoms."" The injectable drug Ozempic is shown, July 1, 2023, in Houston. Ozempic is a medicine for adults with type 2 diabetes. (David J. Phillip / AP) Right now, the only ways to address diabetic peripheral neuropathy are to prevent diabetes in the first place or to manage it carefully once diagnosed, said Eid of the University of Michigan Medical School. ""The American Diabetes Association recommends diet and exercise to reduce nerve damage in patients with neuropathy or patients who have prediabetes, but they may be unwilling or unable to do it,"" Eid said. ""Compliance is a real issue. Sometimes it could be a comorbidity like if they have cardiac problems or it could be they have mental issues - depression is very common in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Sometimes it's just that they're unmotivated, they dont want to do it."" Advertisement Finding a treatment that people with diabetes can stick with is crucial. About 38 million Americans - nearly 12% of the U.S. population - have diabetes, a number expected to climb past 55 million by 2030. Total annual medical and societal costs tied to the disease are also projected to rise by 53%, topping $622 billion by 2030. Shiers hopes the study will steer preclinical research toward understanding how Nageotte nodules shape the dorsal root ganglions role in chronic pain. ""The preclinical pain field isn't aware of [Nageotte nodules] because they havent shown up in our animal models and nobody has reported on them,"" Shiers said. ""We hope these data sets can be used to really guide preclinical studies and so some of these questions [about pain] can start being answered.""

Submit questions here. Dear Prudence, My boyfriend has been having a series of rolling health issues that require emergency room trips, which is awful. But the worst thing is how he acts when he's there: He doesn't ask questions, push for care, or remind the medical staff that he's alive. He had a cardiac event instead of warning the nurse about his symptoms because he worried he was ""bothering"" the guy who had other patients. In every ER I've been to, if you aren't firm to the point of pushy, you won't get medical care. I work two hours away, so I can't always be there immediately. I love and care for him, but I'm not his mom. Going to the doctor or the ER when things go wrong, but then not actually asking any questions or telling the doctor about his symptoms is becoming a huge problem. He'll go home, and the problem will continue untreated, and I'll end up driving him back to the ER when I get home, or we'll have to make a second expensive specialist appointment because he didn't ask for answers the first time. I can't always be there, and honestly, navigating doctors for an adult who won't do it for himself is the least sexy thing I can imagine. I know I need to be sympathetic because he's sick and scared, but I'm mad. I know self-advocacy wouldn't make him not sick, but it would help! I'm out of PTO and worried about what will happen next time he has an emergency if I can't leave work. As a teenager, I was hospitalized alone in a foreign country where I didn't speak the language, and broken bones/work accidents/severe asthma have sent me to ERs in the States plenty of times since. I've always come out metaphorically fighting. I know it sucks, but if you don't tell people what you need in an understaffed system, you won't get it. What can I do? Telling him to be firm isn't helping. -Act Like You Want to Live Dear Act Like You Want to Live, I don't want to come off as too harsh here, so I'll start off with an admission: I once cried because I thought my husband (then fiance) didn't drink enough water. He was fine. I just worried that he might one day become dehydrated. So, I totally get loving someone and wanting them to take better care of themselves. But that little breakdown over hydration concerns is now a joke in my marriage because, well, it was ridiculous! You have to remind yourself, like I did, when I realized that: This is an adult we're talking about. You mentioned that you're not his mom. And it doesn't sound like he's even complained to you or asked for help. Also, it's not as if he has a dangerous disease and is refusing treatment. He's going to the hospital, he's just not being quite as assertive as you would be. That's allowed. And it's not an automatic death sentence. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement I think you're right that self-advocacy and assertiveness help to get results in medical settings, but the healthy thing to do would be to share that insight with him and then just stop. Don't push. Don't stress. Let him make his own choices, reminding yourself that all different kinds of people with all different kinds of personalities find their way in life without your guidance. And if it feels hard to imagine washing your hands of the situation, given your love and care for him, think of it this way: At this point, you're bossing him around and being angry and frustrated, but you're not actually succeeding in getting him better care. So what is there to lose if you allow him to manage things on his own? If it's partially the finances you're worried about, he can schedule and pay for the pricey specialist follow-up visit himself. Advertisement One last thought: I often find that when I'm really wound up about someone else not doing something the ""right"" way, I'm focusing on their shortcomings instead of something in my own life that needs improvement just as urgently.

I have a friend who's from the same background as me. The thing is, I'm pretty sure he likes guys. I don't know if there's anyone in his life he's opened up to about this, but I want to somehow let him know I'd be a safe person to talk to. I don't feel like I can just ask him, as it isn't really anyone's business if he's not ready to share. But it hurts to imagine that he may be suffering in silence. Advertisement Advertisement Sometimes when he says something disparaging about LGBTQ+ people, I'll gently push back with something along the lines of ""being LGBTQ+ is not the end of the world."" But I'm afraid if I were to push back any harder than that, or if I hint too much about what I suspect, I could scare him away. Sadly, I feel like there's absolutely nothing I can do until he decides he's ready. Am I right? -Questioning Whether or Not He's Questioning Dear Questioning, I think you could take a harder stance than saying it's ""not the end of the world.""

And if you're ""out"" as an ally, you could use what you post and share on social media to signal that you're not homophobic, and are not OK with LGBTQ+ people being discriminated against or otherwise mistreated. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In addition, work on giving off accepting energy in other ways, which means making sure that in your everyday conversations, you're not being too critical of anyone. Be gentle with your friend if he comes to you with less controversial admissions-like if he misses the deadline to file his taxes, doesn't get into dental school, or tells you he has social anxiety. Make sure you encourage him to be kind to himself, normalize what he's going through, and remind him how highly you think of him. Hopefully, if the day comes that he's wondering, ""Who could I talk to about liking guys?"" you'll pop up in his mind as someone who's always been an open-minded, non-judgmental friend. Advertisement Finally, remember that even if you're right about his sexual orientation (don't be too sure that you are!) and even if you send all the right messages, the decision about whether to come out is going to be informed by a lot of different factors, and one supportive person might not be enough to make him feel he can do it safely.

What does science say about the claimed health benefits? Sometimes I wonder why I do these things to my body. I'd just been for a mid-winter run in a frozen park in the Finnish city of Oulu. The air temperature was -15C (5F). At 170km (106m) south of the Arctic Circle, this is the world's northernmost Parkrun. Less than an hour later, I ducked into a sauna - a dimly-lit wooden room where intense heat was radiating from a massive wood-burning stove. The thermometer read 85C (185F). As I sat there, sweating like crazy, a fellow sauna-goer threw a ladleful of water onto the stove's hot stones to make ""loyly"" - Finnish for a sudden burst of steam that surges through the air. It's a powerful sensation, almost shocking. The heat reached deep into my skin and muscles, melting away any tension. But that wasn't enough for me. Stepping outside into the cold air, steam rose from my body, and I clambered down an ice-encrusted ladder into the excruciatingly cold water of the Oulu River, which had a temperature of around 1C (34F). I felt piercing pain, like a million needles striking my skin. But I didn't jump out. Instead, I counted slowly up to 12. And after a few seconds the pain seemd to disappear - I actually felt okay with it. It was almost like an icy hug. When I clambered out, the air around me seemed almost warm. To some, it might sound like the morning schedule of a deranged masochist. But this sequence of cold, hot and then cold again made me feel strangely alive. A sauna followed by an ice bath is known as contrast therapy in sports medicine - and it feels surprisingly good. When I do it, I experience a rush of energy, which gives way to a mood of happiness. To those outside of Finland the lurch from cold, to hot and to cold again can seem extreme, but it is a health craze that is now spreading beyond Scandinavian borders to other parts of the world. So I wanted to delve into the science behind the Finnish sauna and find out whether it really is good for me. Antti Leinonen Erika Benke, the author of this article, has been enjoying saunas combined with ice plunges for years (Credit: Antti Leinonen) ""Finns go to the sauna at least once a week and spend between five to 30 minutes in about 80-100C (176-212F) heat,"" says Heikki Junkkari, a doctor who sits on the board of the Finnish Sauna Society , an organisation that has promoted Finnish sauna culture since 1937. Saunas have existed for thousands of years and going to them is a deeply-rooted part of Finnish life. It unites Finns across generations and regions. Saunas have even made it onto Unesco's Intangible Heritage List. There are an estimated 3.3 million saunas in this country of 5.5 million people, meaning they are accessible to almost everyone. Sauna users often cool off in an icy lake or river or take a cold shower. People typically alternate between hot and cold several times, says Junkkari. But going from heat to ice is an intense experience that affects blood circulation in the human body, says Setor Kunutsor, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at the University of Manitoba. ""When you go to the sauna, the temperature inside the body goes up slowly from 37C (99F) to as high as 39C (102F). Blood vessels dilate, you start sweating and that reduces blood pressure,"" he says. ""Being immersed in cold water does the opposite: blood vessels contract and blood pressure goes up."" Many medical papers have discussed the potential health benefits and risks of saunas and cold baths, but Junkkari warns that many of these studies lack scientific quality. ""Very few studies are good quality randomised controlled trials,"" he says, referring to a scientific methodology in which participants in a study are randomly sorted into groups in order to test the effectiveness of a drug, activity or some other intervention. There could be positive effects of sauna use on respiratory health, dementia and cardiovascular health There are also reports in the medical literature of people who have fallen ill and even died after diving straight from the heat of a sauna into ice cold water. One 1998 study, for example, reported the case of a person in Japan who died from a heart attack after entering cold water immediately after leaving a sauna. Data suggests, however, that these incidents are extremely rare. Most tend to involve people who have been drinking alcohol or have pre-existing conditions. There have been some studies, however, that also warn short sauna baths interspersed with rapid cooling is associated with heart arrhythmia in patients with existing cardiovascular disease. A case report published earlier this year also warned how a patient needed hospital care in Birmingham, UK, for 12 days after suffering heatstroke in a sauna that led to a heart attack, seizures and injury to the liver and kidneys. But there is other evidence that suggests sauna bathing may well have a protective effect against sudden cardiac death. Kunutsor has worked with Finnish cardiologist and reseracher Jari Laukkanen on some of the largest sauna and ice bath studies to date. Their research is based on data collected during a 20-year period, involving 2,682 middle-aged and older men in eastern Finland. ""Going to the sauna a few times a week is associated with a reduced risk of high blood pressure, heart disease and sudden cardiac death,"" says Kunutsor. The reason, he and his colleagues suspect, may be linked to the effect sauna bathing and cold immersion has on the cardiovascular system as blood vessels rapidly dilate and contract. This may reduce arterial stiffness, they say, but also help to control other risk factors such as inflammation and stress. Getty Images In Finland it is common to combine sauna bathing with a plunge in ice cold water (Credit: Getty Images) Those who combine sauna with exercise may experience even more cardiovascular benefits, adds Kunutsor. He and colleagues set up a randomised controlled trial in which one group of 47 participants used a sauna and did exercise three times a week, for eight weeks, while another group only did the exercise. ""We found that sauna sessions combined with exercise produced a mean reduction of eight millimetres of mercury,"" says Kunutsor, referring to a measure of blood pressure. ""This is a very substantial reduction."" There is also some research that suggests sauna use might also be good for the brain. In 2017, Kunutsor and his colleagues published a study of more than 2,300 men over a 20-year period. Men who took part in two to three sauna sessions a week had a 20% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and 22% lower risk of dementia than those who only took one weekly sauna. The effect was enhanced the more frequent the sauna use was, with a 66% reduction in dementia and 65% in Alzheimer's disease among those who used a sauna between four and seven times per week, compared with those who only used the sauna once per week. ""We've found a strong inverse association between the frequency of sauna bathing and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease,"" says Kunutsor. The study did not, however, compare the effects of a sauna against the risk in men who did not use saunas at all and so the results may also reflect something more generally about the lifestyles of people who have time to indulge in sauna bathing in the first place. It is also worth remembering such observational results do not necessarily mean a direct cause and effect relationship between saunas and dementia. Instead it provides a glimpse at an effect that warrants further research. Nonetheless, Kunutsor and Laukkanen's observational research has also found hints that frequent sauna bathing may reduce the risk of mental disorders. Sauna played a key role helping us find peace, giving rhythm to our lives - Juha Mieto Anecdotal reports of psychological benefits associated with sauna use include that of Juha Mieto, a well-known Finnish cross-country skier. He credits saunas with restoring both his and his son's mental well-being after the sudden death of his wife. ""It was a huge shock. My son had just turned eight. I started heating the sauna at 6pm every evening. It became a ritual that brought us calm,"" Mieto recalls. ""We kept this up for many years. Sauna played a key role helping us find peace, giving rhythm to our lives."" One possible explanation is that people find sitting in a hot, scent-filled room relaxing by triggering short-term changes in certain hormone levels. A randomised controlled study found that regular sauna bathing was effective at reducing the intensity of chronic tension headaches, for example. ""When you go to the sauna, hormones that respond to physiological stress will increase. Levels of endorphins, our body's natural mood-boosters, our internal feel-good chemicals, will go up,"" says Ilpo Huhtaniemi, an endocrinologist at Imperial College London, who co-authored a review of research on how saunas effect hormones. ""There's also an increase in growth hormone levels, although all these hormonal changes tend to be short-term."" Martha Newson, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Greenwich in the UK, is currently conducting a study with the British Sauna Society to assess how the rituals associated with sauna bathing can effect people's mental wellbeing. ""Sauna is a space where our norms and conventions are temporarily suspended - we take off our clothes, sit in close proximity, and endure extremes together,"" she says. ""These are great, ritual environments for our identities to transform."" Sauna therapist Laura Foon says the warm, calm atmosphere induces a sense of relaxation. ""Today, we're constantly on high alert,"" she says. ""Diving into soothing darkness in the sauna is profoundly healing."" It is like returning to the womb, she suggests. The sauna is a reassuringly safe space. But what about when you skip out of the sauna and plunge yourself into a lake shrouded in ice? That's not exactly womb-like. The Finnish secret to happiness: Avanto and Loyly When a person enters cold water, they experience an increase in heart rate and blood pressure - a reaction known as ""cold shock"". Generally, their heart rate and blood pressure return to normal levels shortly after leaving the water. Somewhat counterintuitively, regular exposure to cold water can lead to a remarkable change in the opposite direction: a decrease in both average heart rate and blood pressure. Huhtaniemi says there's also a hormonal reaction: the cold triggers a release of neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, which plays an important role in the body's ""fight-or-flight"" response. It increases blood pressure and causes heightened alertness, also giving a boost of energy. ""Cold water raises the levels of other hormones such as serotonin, cortisol, dopamine and endorphin that play a role in emotion and stress regulation,"" Huhtaniemi says. Ice baths can have various effects on both our bodies and minds, says Antti Lindfors, a cultural researcher at the University of Helsinki, and an ice swimmer who has interviewed other winter swimmers about their experiences. His main finding, based on 640 responses, is that ice swimmers say the activity makes them feel bolder and more self-confident. ""People view entering a frozen body of water as a mental feat. Once you've done it, everything else becomes less of a struggle,"" says Lindfors. Erika Benke Laura Foon says saunas provide people with a safe space to relax (Credit: Erika Benke) Studies suggest that cold amplifies emotions and bodily sensations. Lindfors hypothesises that learning to relax while in cold-induced pain, for example, may help people deal with stress in other areas of their lives. One Finnish study of 49 people found that winter swimmers reported reduced tiredness, improved mood and self-esteem versus a control group. ""Winter swimming is probably not a miracle treatment for mental health problems but it's worth trying out,"" says Lindfors. ""The key to success is learning to accept the cold rather than shutting down for a few painful seconds and quickly escaping."" Lindfors suggests that the best results occur when people endure temperatures of between 0-10C (32-50F), and over a period of at least 30 seconds for two or three times a week. That said, swimming in very cold water can be dangerous. Some people have died during cold water swimming sessions, due to risks including cold shock and incapacitation. Medical experts say that it can raise your blood pressure to dangerous levels, especially in people with undiagnosed heart conditions, for example. They also recommend having supervision or help close by when undertaking cold water swimming, in case you get into difficulties. There is also the risk of hypothermia if people remain immersed in the cold water for too long. Lindfors cautions that it is important for cold water bathers to acclimatise to the experience by using progressively colder water. ""It will take about two weeks for the body to adapt. It's important not to overdo it; stay as long as it feels right,"" he says. Huhtaniemi agrees. ""Doing it little by little is very important,"" he says. ""Gradual adaptation helps minimise any negative effects."" Lindfors and Huhtaniemi say it is still not clear how years of ice baths may affect the human body - there have been no long-term studies on this. Knowing there is at least some research supporting the health benefits of saunas and ice baths has added depth to what was previously just a ""feels good"" ritual for me. Hopefully my body will be a bit more grateful too. * All content within this article is provided for general information only and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of health care professionals. -- For trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights."
A husband and wife photographed each other during her cancer journey.

Anna and her husband, Jordan, both photographers, began documenting Anna's treatment and the way cancer affected their entire family. But they didn't look closely at the images until years later, when they began collecting photographers for a book, ""HER2: The Diagnosed, the Caregiver, and Their Son."" Below, Anna and Jordan each describe how photography allowed them to process their experience. You can also listen to them discuss the project on the ""First Opinion Podcast."" Anna Rathkopf At my five-year oncology visit, my doctor told me I was being transferred to survivorship care and, hopefully, I'd never need to see her again. Instead of relief, I had an intense feeling of fear. I realized I was afraid to enter ""survivorship."" advertisement In the months that followed, I felt the urgent need to process what I had gone through, something tangible to help me express and understand the emotions I had buried. I turned to the photography project that had documented our journey and decided to make a book. We titled it ""HER2,"" named ironically after the protein that characterizes my cancer. I thought I was ready to face what I had survived, but I didn't expect the process to profoundly change the way I saw those around me, especially Jordan. Anna Rathkopf Anna Rathkopf While I was eager to make the book, Jordan was not. He didn't want to revisit some of the most painful moments of our lives, and at first, I couldn't understand why. As we worked on it together, I began to realize how much I had overlooked his struggles, and how painful it was for him to relive what he had privately endured. advertisement From the moment I heard the words, ""You have cancer,"" my world turned inward. My focus became survival, on my body, my fear, and shielding our son, Jesse, then 2 1/2, as best I could. Jordan, on the other hand, seemed rock solid: always driving me to treatments, holding my hand, reassuring me I'd be OK, researching side effects, taking notes, and asking the doctors questions, all while working and caring for Jesse on the days I couldn't. He never seemed to falter, and I relied on his strength without any doubt that he would be there for me. I didn't see his fear, his sadness, or how deeply he was struggling. I didn't fully understand how triggering it was for Jordan - how my diagnosis reopened the wounds of his mother's cancer when he was just a child. She survived, but the experience marked him for life. And if I'm being honest, I didn't think about any of that at the time. I was focused on surviving. Meanwhile, he carried all of it quietly, never letting me see just how heavy it really was. Jordan Rathkopf His photos told a story I hadn't seen. They showed how he saw me: strong, beautiful, and worthy, even at my lowest. While I felt broken and disconnected from my body, his images held me with love and care. But one thing was glaringly obvious: Jordan was missing. His photos were all of me, or of me with Jesse, or me with other friends and family. It was as though he had erased himself, as if his role in the story didn't matter. I had taken self-portraits throughout, raw and unfiltered, showing my pain and vulnerability. Jordan had taken none of himself. His absence in the photos revealed how deeply his world had revolved around mine. The balance we'd once shared had shifted entirely toward me and Jesse, leaving him feeling invisible. It struck me how common this is for caregivers, who often feel their experiences are secondary, as though they exist only to support others. Anna Rathkopf One photo in particular really revealed to me the different ways we were experiencing my illness. It was a photo taken by me in my doctor's office. I was joking around in the foreground, trying to distract myself. In the background, a mirror reflected Jordan's head slumped, shoulders hunched, the weight of the hospital walls pressing down on him. That image shattered me. I hadn't realized how much he was carrying: every appointment, every drive, every moment caring for Jesse. His love for me was tied to his fear of losing me, and it had consumed him in ways I had never understood. advertisement Another photo haunts me: Jordan's eyes in a car's rearview mirror. At the time, I was grateful he was driving, sparing me from the chaos of New York City traffic and public transportation. But when we worked on the book, he told me that image made him sad. It reminded him of the times he went to the car to cry, not wanting me to see how scared he was. Hearing that broke my heart. We had been so focused on me that we hadn't processed his pain. Anna Rathkopf Looking back at the photos from these past eight years - diagnosis, treatment, and ""survivorship"" - I now see Jordan's love in every frame. But I also see the sacrifices he made, the pain he quietly carried and the way it has continued to shape his life. His images helped me understand how terrifying it must have been for him to watch me during treatment, to see my body change, and to shoulder the weight of our family's survival. Through Jordan's lens, I began to see myself differently. Even when I felt weak and angry at my body, he saw strength. His love, and the love of my family, carried me through moments when I felt I couldn't carry myself. At the same time, his photos opened my eyes to the impact my illness had on everyone around me and how deeply they were all affected in ways I hadn't fully appreciated. Jordan Rathkopf Jordan Rathkopf Making ""HER2"" hasn't been easy. In fact, it was much harder than I anticipated. It forced us to revisit moments we both wished we could leave behind. But in doing so, it gave us something we didn't expect: understanding. It helped us see each other's experiences not just as a patient and a caregiver, but as partners in a shared, messy, and deeply human story. We created ""HER2"" because we hadn't seen a story like ours: a young family navigating cancer together that did not lean into melodrama and did not promote fake positivity. It just showed life as it is, with its ups and its downs. It's the book and project we wish we'd had when I was diagnosed. Through this project, we've finally started to understand each other's pain and resilience, and it's helped us move forward together. advertisement Jordan Rathkopf Anna Rathkopf Jordan Rathkopf While searching for client images, I came across an unfamiliar hard drive on our desk. Hoping it contained what I needed, I plugged it in and opened a folder labeled ""Photos 2016-2019."" Inside, I found hundreds of images Anna had taken of herself over the years, self-portraits in environments I didn't recognize and some literally in our living room and shared spaces. Some were in hospital rooms, others on the beach or dimly lit spaces, capturing her reflection in cracked mirrors or her body sprawled exhausted, motionless. Among these were photos of flowers and landscapes, blurry shots of our son, and many of me in moments in which I did not even realize I was being captured. But it was the self-portraits, raw, vulnerable, and intimate that changed so much of how I now have come to understand her experience. They revealed a side of Anna I hadn't seen as if I were stepping into a hidden part of her world. It was like looking through a diary I wasn't meant to read, but I could not look away. These were Anna's photos, taken during the years following her breast cancer diagnosis. Viewing them for the first time, I realized how much she had hidden from me. And over time, talking together about why she took these photos helped me understand her perspective as the diagnosed. Jordan Rathkopf During those years, I focused on documenting moments of love and resilience in Anna. But her photos told a different story, a story I hadn't seen or perhaps hadn't wanted to see. Her self-portraits revealed vulnerability and grief: fear in her eyes, her body limp with exhaustion, and moments of fragile stillness in unfamiliar settings. Her images exposed her struggle with profound loss, feeling betrayed by her body, and the fear of leaving Jesse and me behind. Anna Rathkopf It also made me realize how much pressure she was carrying. To be a good mom, a supportive partner, to stay strong, beautiful, composed - even as her body was being torn apart. I remember showing her a photo I took during the thick of treatment. She was emaciated from chemo and radiation. Her reaction startled me: ""Wow, look how good I looked. I was so thin."" That moment revealed to me how much she had internalized expectations of her appearance as a woman. Seeing her photos next to mine, I started to realize just how much I hadn't fully seen. advertisement Jordan Rathkopf Anna Rathkopf Anna Rathkopf Jordan Rathkopf Amid the darkness, Anna's photos revealed moments of light, our son resting with melting ice cream in his hand, roses leaning into the sunlight, and a tender self-portrait of her kissing her mother's forehead. Through her lens, I saw the love she felt for her family and the beauty she found in everyday moments. These were her anchors, the reasons she held on. When I showed her the folder and asked why she hadn't shared the photos, she seemed surprised. She barely remembered taking many of them, lost in the fog of chemo brain, radiation exhaustion, and depression. As we talked, she opened up about feeling disconnected from her body, grieving her lost fertility, and the guilt she was feeling over what she thought she put us through. She also admitted to feeling deep and lingering anger at cancer, at her body, and at herself. Jordan Rathkopf Jordan Rathkopf Over the years, Anna's photography has continued to evolve. Her newer images reflect a delicate balance of vulnerability and strength. They reveal a woman still grappling with the scars of illness but also reclaiming parts of herself. Through her lens, I've seen her find joy in our son's laughter, solace in nature, and quiet moments of love within our family. These photos have grounded her in a life reshaped by illness, a life marked by both pain and beauty. Anna's images also taught me how much I had misunderstood her experience. While I focused on documenting her strength, her photos revealed the fear, anger, and isolation she carried. They showed how often she felt alone, disconnected from her body, and distant from her sense of self. Anna Rathkopf Anna Rathkopf Her photos taught me about myself too. I thought I had hidden my pain, believing I needed to stay steady for her. But her images of me slumped in hospital chairs, clinging to our son revealed my vulnerability. She didn't see it as weakness; she saw it as love. Through Anna's lens, I've come to see her and myself in ways I never had before. Her photos don't just tell her story; they challenge the one I thought I already understood. They reveal not only the pain she carried but also the beauty she found in small, fleeting moments. And in doing so, they've brought us closer to truly seeing each other. advertisement Anna Rathkopf Anna and Jordan Rathkopf are Brooklyn-based photographers and co-founders of The Rathkopfs, a media production company specializing in visual storytelling centered on identity and health. Their collaborative work includes the book ""HER2: The Diagnosed, The Caregiver and Their Son,"" which documents their family's journey through breast cancer."
Sitting Could Be Shrinking Your Brain (And Exercise May Not Help) - ScienceAlert,health,"Sitting might be a comfortable and convenient way to spend much of your day, but a new study of older adults suggests it can lead to brain shrinkage and cognitive issues, irrespective of how much exercise you're managing to fit in.",David Nield,ScienceAlert,2025-05-21T03:34:10+00:00,"Sitting might be a comfortable and convenient way to spend much of your day, but a new study of older adults suggests it can lead to brain shrinkage and cognitive issues, irrespective of how much exercise you're managing to fit in.

The research counters the idea that periods of sitting can be balanced out by periods of being active, at least when it comes to brain health in people aged 50 or above. The study researchers, from Vanderbilt University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Seoul National University, think that too much sitting or lying down (known as sedentary behavior) can impact the brain and increase the risk of different types of dementia later in life, including Alzheimer's disease. ""Reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease is not just about working out once a day,"" says neurologist Marissa Gogniat, from the University of Pittsburgh. ""Minimizing the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease."" The researchers recruited 404 volunteers, tracking their activity levels with wearables over the course of a week. Then, over the next seven years, cognitive tests and brain scans were used to assess their brain health. Even though 87 percent of the volunteers were meeting the recommended weekly guidelines of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, those who sat more overall showed worse cognition. They also showed more signs of neurodegeneration - including a faster thinning of the hippocampus, a part of the brain crucial to memory function and one of the first areas to show damage from Alzheimer's. The association wasn't huge, and doesn't prove direct cause and effect, but it was noticeable: spending more time sitting seems to age the brain faster, and reducing that amount of time, rather than just exercising more, appears to be the best antidote. Stronger associations were found in those already at a higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's, the data shows. ""This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among aging adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease,"" says neurologist Angela Jefferson, from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time."" Of course, these findings aren't a reason to give up more vigorous exercise. We know that being active does wonders for our physical and mental health, and even small amounts of exercise can keep the brain sharp. What's most important here is that extra hours sitting down were linked to certain kinds of wear and tear in the brain. This isn't the first time that sedentary behavior has been linked with dementia and Alzheimer's, but it's another important and comprehensive set of data that researchers and health professionals can draw on. ""It is critical to study lifestyle choices and the impact they have on brain health as we age,"" says Jefferson. The research has been published in Alzheimer's & Dementia."

The discovery points to a microbial influence on cancer risk from an early age. An international team of researchers, led by the University of California San Diego, has identified a possible microbial factor contributing to the alarming increase in early-onset colorectal cancer: a bacterial toxin known as colibactin. Colibactin is produced by specific strains of Escherichia coli that inhabit the colon and rectum. This toxin has the ability to damage DNA, and the new research shows that exposure to colibactin during early childhood can leave a lasting genetic ""scar"" on colon cells. This distinct mutation pattern may significantly raise the risk of developing colorectal cancer before the age of 50. The study, published April 23 in Nature, examined the genomes of 981 colorectal cancer tumors from patients with both early- and late-onset disease across 11 countries with varying cancer rates. Researchers found that the DNA mutation pattern linked to colibactin was 3.3 times more common in early-onset cases, particularly among adults under the age of 40, compared to those diagnosed after age 70. These specific mutations were also more frequently observed in countries with higher rates of early-onset colorectal cancer. ""These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease,"" said study senior author Ludmil Alexandrov, professor in the Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering and the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego, who is also a member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center and Deputy Director of Sanford Stem Cell Fitness and Space Medicine Center. Although previous studies-including earlier work from Alexandrov's lab- have identified colibactin-related mutations in roughly 10 to 15 percent of all colorectal cancer cases, those studies either focused on late-onset cases or did not distinguish between early- and late-onset disease. This latest study is the first to demonstrate a substantial enrichment of colibactin-related mutations specifically in early-onset cases. The implications are sobering. Once considered a disease of older adults, colorectal cancer is now on the rise among young people in at least 27 countries. Its incidence in adults under 50 has roughly doubled every decade for the past 20 years. If current trends continue, colorectal cancer is projected to become the leading cause of cancer-related death among young adults by 2030. Until now, the reasons behind this surge have remained unknown. Young adults diagnosed with colorectal cancer often have no family history of the disease and few known risk factors such as obesity or hypertension. That has fueled speculation about potential hidden environmental or microbial exposures-something this new study directly investigates. ""When we started this project, we weren't planning to focus on early-onset colorectal cancer,"" said study co-first author Marcos Diaz-Gay, a former postdoctoral researcher in Alexandrov's lab. ""Our original goal was to examine global patterns of colorectal cancer to understand why some countries have much higher rates than others. But as we dug into the data, one of the most interesting and striking findings was how frequently colibactin-related mutations appeared in the early-onset cases."" According to the team's analysis, colibactin's damaging effects begin early. By molecularly timing each mutational signature identified in this study, the researchers demonstrate that colibactin-associated mutations arise early in tumor development, consistent with prior studies showing that such mutations occur within the first 10 years of life. The study also reveals that colibactin-related mutations account for approximately 15% of what are known as APC driver mutations-some of the earliest genetic alterations that directly promote cancer development-in colorectal cancer. ""If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they're 10 years old,"" Alexandrov explained, ""they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60."" In other words, colibactin-producing bacteria may be silently colonizing children's colons, initiating molecular changes in their DNA, and potentially setting the stage for colorectal cancer long before any symptoms arise. Alexandrov cautioned that while their findings provide strong support for this hypothesis, further research is necessary to establish causality. Building on past breakthroughs This work-part of Cancer Grand Challenges team Mutographs, funded by Cancer Research UK-is the latest milestone in a growing body of research that Alexandrov, Diaz-Gay, and colleagues have been advancing over the past several years. Their specialty lies in decoding patterns of DNA mutations caused by environmental exposures-such as UV radiation and bacterial toxins-and lifestyle behaviors like smoking and drinking. Each factor leaves a distinct genetic fingerprint in the genome, a unique mutational signature that can help pinpoint the origins of certain cancers. As part of a long-term collaboration between UC San Diego, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (France), and the Wellcome Sanger Institute (UK), enabled by Cancer Grand Challenges funding, team Mutographs has elucidated the mutational processes underlying esophageal, kidney, and head and neck cancers worldwide. This most recent result on colorectal cancer further expands the global understanding of cancer etiology through mutational signature analysis. By systematically cataloging these mutational patterns across thousands of cancer genomes, the researchers have been working to identify new causes of cancer that had previously flown under the radar. ""Not every environmental factor or behavior we study leaves a mark on our genome,"" said Alexandrov. ""But we've found that colibactin is one of those that can. In this case, its genetic imprint appears to be strongly associated with colorectal cancers in young adults. Ongoing work The team's latest discovery raises a host of new questions. How are children being exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria, and what can be done to prevent or mitigate that exposure? Are certain environments, diets or lifestyle behaviors more conducive to colibactin production? How can people find out if they already have these mutations? The team is investigating several hypotheses while also further examining the correlation between colibactin and the risk of early-onset colorectal cancer. In addition, they are exploring whether the use of probiotics could safely eliminate harmful bacterial strains. They are also developing early detection tests that analyze stool samples for colibactin-related mutations. In the meantime, the team is continuing its global search for cancer-linked mutational signatures. In the recent Nature study, the team also found that colorectal cancers from specific countries-particularly Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and Thailand-showed an increase in certain mutational signatures. This suggests that local environmental exposures may also contribute to cancer risk. ""It's possible that different countries have different unknown causes,"" said Diaz-Gay, who is launching a new phase of the study in his newly established lab at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO) in Madrid, Spain. ""That could open up the potential for targeted, region-specific prevention strategies."" Alexandrov noted a broader implication of the research: that many cancers may originate from environmental or microbial exposures in early life, long before diagnosis. ""This reshapes how we think about cancer,"" he said. ""It might not be just about what happens in adulthood-cancer could potentially be influenced by events in early life, perhaps even the first few years. Sustained investment in this type of research will be critical in the global effort to prevent and treat cancer before it's too late.""

The individual is considered unvaccinated because they were unable to provide documentation of receiving the measles vaccine. The individual was contagious beginning Thursday May 11, 2025, until May 19, 2025. The individual has received care, and public health officials are working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed. Individuals who were at the places at the times listed below may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to this individual. While the individual was not considered infectious during visits to the listed locations before May 11, these locations are being included out of an abundance of caution due to the small possibility of early transmission. May 10, 2025 8:00 AM- 6:00 PM Kohls - Sephora 20185 Marketplace Ave, Kyle, TX 78640 May 10, 2025 8:00 AM- 6:00 PM H-E-B Plus 5401 Farm to Market 1626, Kyle, TX 78640 May 13, 2025 11:47 AM- 2:23 PM CommuniCare- Kyle Clinic 2810 Dacy Lane, Kyle, TX 78640 May 13, 2025 8:00 AM- 1:00 PM Texas Department of Public Safety 1400 N IH 35, San Marcos, TX 78666 May 16, 2025 12:50 PM- 5:30 PM Ascension Seton Hays 6001 Kyle Parkway, Kyle, TX 78640 In collaboration with DSHS, individuals who may have been exposed will be notified by their respective local health authority. HCHD, DSHS and other local health agencies are working closely together to investigate the potential contacts. ""Our department has thoroughly prepared for the chance of a positive measles case within the county. We have learned from the many lessons identified from the measles exposure in February of this year,"" Gonzales said. ""We are working closely with the healthcare providers and businesses exposed to ensure the safety of their patients and customers. The health and safety of our residents is our priority. Our focus will be ensuring those who are exposed are notified and capable of taking the proper precautions for their health and to prevent the further exposure of other individuals."" HCHD will contact people who are known to have been in contact with the person who later tested positive for measles to provide guidance and conduct case investigations. Ninety percent of people who are not vaccinated or have not had a previous measles infection will become infected with the virus. If an individual has symptoms, they should contact their primary care provider, an urgent care or an emergency room to set up an appointment and quarantine for four days after the onset of a rash. People who were in the aforementioned locations during the specified times should: Review their immunization and medical records to determine if they are protected against measles infection. People who have not had measles infection or received measles immunization previously may not be protected from the measles virus and should talk with a health care provider about receiving measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization. Contact and notify their health care provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if they are pregnant, have an infant or have a weakened immune system regardless of vaccination history. Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash from four days to 21 days after their exposure (the time period when symptoms may develop). If symptoms develop, stay at home and avoid school, work and any large gatherings. Call a healthcare provider immediately. Do not enter a health care facility before calling and making them aware of your measles exposure and symptoms. The health department can assist healthcare providers in appropriately diagnosing and managing your care. Post-exposure prophylaxis: Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) refers to medical treatment given after someone has been exposed to a contagious disease, in this case measles, with the goal of preventing infection or reducing the severity of illness. PEP is most effective when administered as soon as possible after exposure and can significantly lower the risk of developing the disease. There are two primary forms of PEP for measles: the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine and immune globulin (IG), each appropriate for different situations. MMR Vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis: The Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine can provide protection if administered within 72 hours (3 days) of the initial exposure. This option is recommended for most healthy individuals aged 6 months and older who have not been fully vaccinated or whose immunity is uncertain. Immune Globulin (IG) IG is a preparation of antibodies that provides temporary protection against measles. It can be administered after exposure to help prevent or lessen the severity of the disease, especially in people who are at higher risk of serious illness. Immune globulin (IG) may offer protection when given within 6 days of exposure. IG is typically reserved for infants, pregnant individuals without immunity or those who are immunocompromised. If you think you may have been in close contact with someone who has measles and are unsure of your immunity: Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible to find out if post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is appropriate for you and which type (MMR vaccine or immune globulin) is best based on your age, health status, and vaccination history. You can also call the Hays County Health Department at (512) 393-5520 for additional guidance or assistance. If you are a resident of Travis County who was exposed, please contact Austin Public Health at (512) 972-5555.

About Measles  Measles spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. The virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for two hours, even after the infected person has left. The infected person can spread the disease up to four days before a measles rash appears and up to four days after the rash appears. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses or mouths, they can become infected. Common symptoms for measles include: High fever (as high as 105F) Cough Runny nose Red and watery eyes Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The ""measles rash"" typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body Measles can be prevented with a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR or MMRV). The MMR vaccine protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The MMRV vaccine protects against four diseases: measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox). They are administered in two doses and are highly effective: two doses are 97% effective against measles and one dose is 93% effective. The spread of measles can be prevented if two-dose coverage of vaccine remains at 95% or above in the community. For more information on measles, visit: https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola. Most health insurances cover the cost of the MMR and MMRV vaccine. Insured persons should check with their doctor or local pharmacy to see what vaccines are offered. Uninsured or underinsured children and adults can access free or low-cost vaccines at clinics enrolled in the Vaccines for Children (TVFC) and Adult Safety Net program (ASN). (See attached list of TVFC providers and qualifications for the TVFC program in Hays County). Individuals who do not qualify for TVFC and who do not have insurance can visit a Federally Qualified Health Center. The FQHC for Hays County is CommuniCare. About Hays County Health Department Hays County Health Department is the local health authority for Hays County. The Health Department provides Immunization, Tuberculosis, and Sexually Transmitted Infection services and conducts public health prevention and intervention programming.

For the roughly 805,000 people who have a heart attack every year in the United States, avoiding a second heart attack is a major goal. And new research published in the American Heart Association's journal, Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, has a few tips to do just that. Advertisement The study, which was conducted by researchers at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, found that avoiding a sedentary lifestyle is the best way to fight off a second heart attack or other cardiac event, including chest pain or heart-related surgery. The study followed 609 people ages 21 to 96 who went to the emergency department with symptoms of a heart attack. After leaving the hospital, participants wore movement trackers on their wrists for 30 days. Researchers then followed up a year later to see if additional cardiac events or death occurred. Advertisement Researchers found that those who replaced 30 minutes of sedentary behavior with 30 minutes of light movement of any kind, such as a slow walk or house chores, had a 50% lower chance of having a second heart attack or cardiac event. When folks replaced 30 minutes of sedentary behavior with moderate or vigorous exercise, like a jog or bike ride, their chance of a second heart attack or cardiac event dropped by 61%. One surprising find? Those who replaced sedentary behavior with 30 minutes of sleep had a 14% lower chance of having a second heart attack or cardiac event. ""So, you have options here. Obviously, exercise is going to yield the most bang for your buck and the most benefit, but these other behaviors also matter,"" said Dr. Keith Diaz, the lead study author and director of the exercise testing laboratory at the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health at Columbia University. How does sleep benefit heart health? ""Beyond just this research, [there's] just a whole slew of research emerging now about the heart health benefits of sleep,"" said Diaz. Advertisement Previous research has found that people with irregular sleep patterns have higher amounts of plaque in their arteries, and those who reported poor sleep are also more likely to have high blood pressure (which is a heart attack risk factor). When it comes to the benefits of sleep over being sedentary, ""I think the question we often get as somebody who studies sitting or sedentary behavior is, Well, sleep is sedentary, isn't it? Why is it good?'"" Diaz said. ""And it's just considered to be a separate entity. It's a healthful restorative behavior,"" Diaz said. ""It's really helpful for things like inflammation and just recovery of your body at the end of the day."" Advertisement Getting up and moving around is key for better heart health. Compared to people who averaged fewer than 12 sedentary hours each day (not including sleep), folks who averaged more than 15 sedentary hours per day were 2.5 times more likely to have a cardiac event or die during the study's one-year follow-up. ""I think the important and actionable take-home message is [that] sedentary behavior is deleterious. It's bad for your health after a cardiac event,"" said Dr. Sandeep Nathan, the medical director of the cardiac intensive care unit and co-director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the University of Chicago Medicine's Heart and Vascular Center. Nathan is not affiliated with the study. But there are limitations to this study. ""These were patients who presented with ... acute coronary syndrome symptoms, but only about 25% of these patients actually had a solid diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome,"" said Nathan. Advertisement In other words, not everyone in this study actually had a heart attack; some just went to the emergency room for heart attack symptoms, like chest pain. ""But it doesn't diminish the importance of the primary finding, which is that in anybody who comes in with a constellation of symptoms suggesting that they have heart disease, they do better with physical activity,"" added Nathan. The study also did not consider where study participants lived or their income, which are two factors that can also impact heart health. Advertisement Tatiana Maksimova via Getty Images Moderate to vigorous exercise, such as swimming, running or cycling, can lower your risk of a second heart attack. Physical activity has a range of benefits for heart health. This study underscored a well-established notion: Physical activity of any kind is good for your heart. Overall, it improves your physical and cardiovascular conditioning, Nathan said. Moderate to vigorous exercise also helps control the factors that put you at risk of a heart attack or coronary event, said Nathan. It ""decreases blood sugar levels, it decreases blood pressure. It perhaps helps you lose weight and improve your lipid profiles as well, and all of those are independent risk factors for a second cardiac event,"" Nathan said. Advertisement ""And then finally, what I always tell patients is that if you're consistently maintaining a high level of physical activity, you have a warning system. You can tell me that, Doc, I normally go 30 minutes on the treadmill, but for the past couple of weeks, I hit the 15-minute mark and I just don't feel well,'"" said Nathan. ""That's an early indicator that something's amiss, right?"" If you live a sedentary life, you can't test your heart health the same way. In other words, changes to what you're able to do in your regular fitness regimen can help indicate if you're developing blockages or issues that could cause a second heart attack, said Nathan. Cardiac rehab is also a great tool for lowering your risk of a second heart attack. There is no doubt that avoiding sedentary behavior is good for your cardiovascular health and your overall health. Beyond that, though, Nathan said it's important for those who do have a heart attack to go to (and complete) cardiac rehab as prescribed, as it can help you from having a second heart attack or other cardiac event. Advertisement ""And so, when I counsel patients after a heart attack, I point that out to them,"" Nathan said. ""You may think that you can do this on your own, in your home gym, or in your basement, or your local fitness facility, but there is a substantial benefit to actually going to cardiac rehab and being pushed to engage in escalating intensity of activity for a period of about 12 weeks, typically,"" Nathan noted. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Yellow Fever Resurgence Could Make COVID Look 'Pale' by Comparison - ScienceAlert,health,"Yellow fever is a dangerous mosquito-borne virus that, for hundreds of years, has caused sporadic, deadly outbreaks in the tropics of South America, Central America, and Africa.",Carly Cassella,ScienceAlert,2025-05-20T15:01:21+00:00,"Yellow fever is a dangerous mosquito-borne virus that, for hundreds of years, has caused sporadic, deadly outbreaks in the tropics of South America, Central America, and Africa.

According to a new perspective from infectious disease specialists and the Yellow Fever Advisory Group, the chances of the virus going global have only increased with each passing decade. A recent resurgence in yellow fever cases in Africa and the Americas has experts seriously worried about future spread to the Asia Pacific region. ""The world is clearly at high risk for epidemic/pandemic yellow fever,"" the international team concludes, led by infectious disease specialist Duane Gubler from the National University of Singapore. ""A yellow fever pandemic in today's world would cause a devastating public health crisis that, because of the much higher lethality, would make the COVID-19 pandemic pale by comparison."" Unfortunately, the yellow fever virus has a long history of travel. Prior to the 1600s, yellow fever and its mosquito carriers were endemic to Africa. Later, they spread to the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade, sometimes killing up to 10 percent of local populations in the New World. When the virus began taking over Europe, roughly a century later, it became known as the ""American plague"". The development of a highly effective yellow fever vaccine in the 1930s changed everything. Yellow fever mosquitoes were also almost completely eradicated in the Western Hemisphere, and the two factors stopped urban spread in the Americas. In the decades since, yellow fever mosquitoes have re-infested much of the neotropics, and while Africa continues to experience intermittent epidemics in urban centers, the Americas have been free of a yellow fever epidemic for 80-plus years, only experiencing small and infrequent outbreaks. Scientists are concerned that reprieve won't last for much longer. In recent years, there's been a worrisome resurgence in yellow fever outbreaks in Africa and the Americas, possibly because of poor vaccine coverage, expansion of human populations, lack of travel restrictions, and/or lack of mosquito control. According to Gubler and colleagues, tropical cities that have not historically experienced yellow fever now face ""the greatest risk in over 70 years"" of an epidemic. ""Of primary concern in this regard is the Asia-Pacific region,"" the team adds, ""where over two billion susceptible people live in areas infested by yellow fever mosquitoes."" These mosquito populations aren't carrying the yellow fever virus just yet, but they are species that are capable of doing so. If a human traveller with yellow fever returns to the Asia-Pacific region after travel in Africa or South America, it is possible that local mosquitoes bite them and contract the virus. This could allow for spread among new insect populations in new regions, threatening local humans with a spillover event. ""Today's megacities all have modern airports through which billions of people pass every year, many of them visiting remote locations and carrying exotic pathogens back to crowded tropical cities, where the probability of secondary transmission is increased,"" warns the recent perspective. ""If the virus is introduced to a permissive nonendemic country, especially one located in Asia, the disease might be first misdiagnosed as dengue, likely resulting in spread before being recognized as the yellow fever virus."" So what are we to do? Researchers say that first, we need to expand the global supply of yellow fever vaccines and improve coverage. Otherwise, outbreaks will continue and we won't be ready if the virus spreads to new regions. Gubler and colleagues also argue for increased surveillance of yellow fever cases in poor countries where the disease is endemic, and in non-endemic countries where the virus could possibly spread in the future. ""Immunization services, disease surveillance, and the outbreak response in nearly 50 countries are already being disrupted - with setbacks at a similar level to what we saw during COVID-19,"" warned UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell in April 2025. ""We cannot afford to lose ground in the fight against preventable diseases."" The perspective was published in NPJ Viruses."

It thrives in hidden spaces inside certain sea sponges. A global team has now produced the first detailed map of this worm's genetic activity. This work was led by Dr. Guillermo Ponz-Segrelles at IES El Burgo-Ignacio-Echeverria in Madrid, working with the University of Gottingen. Marine worm grows many branches Experts call this creature Ramisyllis kingghidorahi. It has one anterior region but can form multiple body extensions that spread through its sponge host. Each extension contains full sets of organs, yet they all connect back to the same head. Researchers say this arrangement creates hundreds of potential sites for reproduction. Gene control depends on body part The study measured which genes turn on in different body parts. More variation appeared between the head, midsection, and reproductive zones than between male and female specimens. That suggests body location matters more for genetic control than sex does. Yet the reproductive segments still showed distinct patterns when comparing males and females. Marine worm's midsection Unlike the head or reproductive segments, the worm's midbody showed very little unique genetic activity. This region had fewer upregulated genes, suggesting it may serve mainly as a passive conduit between active zones. What's puzzling is that, in female worms, the midbody still showed distinct expression patterns when compared to males and non-reproductive individuals. Ramisyllis kingghidorahi Male stolon (right hand side): one of the independent reproductive units-growing at the tip of a branch of the worm's body. It has sprouted eyes and will go swimming free to find a stolon of the opposite sex with which to reproduce. The research showed stolons showed localized upregulation of genes related to eye development. Length of the stolon: approx. 1.5 millimeters. Click image to enlarge. Credit: BMC Genomics The reason for this is unclear, and scientists believe future work will be needed to figure out what, if anything, the midbody contributes to reproduction. Each part shows focused gene activity Scientists report that these worms seem to juggle shared anatomy with focused gene activity in each section. Investigators also note that male and female worms both rely on key signals, although each sex shows subtle differences in reproductive regions. Molecular data indicate that many standard body processes are shared, even if actual egg or sperm production diverges. This insight reshapes how specialists think about mature segments Female marine worms activate more genes Across every body region, female worms showed the most distinct patterns of gene expression. Their reproductive segments, midbodies, and even heads activated more unique genes than those of males or non-reproductive individuals. Close-up of female stolen - one of the independent reproductive units - from the worm Ramisyllis kingghidorahi. It has already sprouted eyes and is swimming free to find a stolon of the opposite sex with which to reproduce. Total length of the stolon: approx. 1.5 millimeters. Click image to enlarge. Credit: Maria Teresa Aguado and Guillermo Ponz-Segrelles This might mean that developing female stolons requires a more complex genetic process. It could also reflect earlier or more intense reproductive activity, though the exact reason for this stronger gene response is still unclear. Reproductive hormones barely showed up Researchers expected to see strong genetic signals related to known reproductive hormones like methyl farnesoate, dopamine, and serotonin. But those signals were weak or almost absent in the data. One explanation is that these hormones may act earlier in the worm's development, before the stage when samples were collected. Another possibility is that Ramisyllis kingghidorahi uses a different set of molecular tools entirely, which would set it apart from its relatives. Marine worm genome duplication Some genetic patterns hint at a deeper evolutionary backstory. Researchers found signs that Ramisyllis kingghidorahi may have experienced partial genome duplication in its past. This duplication could help explain the worm's high number of active genes across different body parts. If confirmed, it might also reveal how this species evolved such a complex reproductive system compared to its unbranched relatives. Eyes on every reproductive unit Each specialized reproductive segment, or stolon, sprouts temporary eyes before it separates. These eyes likely help the stolons navigate for mating.

Credit: BMC Genomics This unusual adaptation highlights the worm's skill at sensing its surroundings. Researchers hope further experiments will reveal how these newly formed eyes develop in such a short time. Who decides when to reproduce? One of the biggest mysteries is how a single anterior end, essentially one head, can control hundreds of reproductive sites. Even more confusing, not all of the worm's branches produce stolons at the same time. The study suggests that some branches might receive different signals or respond at different times, but the exact trigger remains unknown. Scientists are still trying to figure out what cues cause some branches to go ahead and create stolons while others stay dormant. Marine worm's control system is still unclear ""We were surprised to find that the head of the worm, which was previously thought to house a sex-specific control system, didn't show the dramatic differences we expected between males and females,"" said Dr Guillermo Ponz-Segrelles, former researcher at the Autonomous University of Madrid. With each new revelation, the puzzle of how these worms fine-tune such a strange body plan keeps growing. Scientists suggest that further work with advanced genomic methods could reveal more about how marine invertebrates adapt to intricate symbiotic habitats. Such data might also offer deeper insights into the evolution of reproductive strategies among annelids. The study is published in BMC Genomics. -- Like what you read?

Rich in clay, olivine, and carbonate minerals, the site promises insights into the watery past of Mars, especially during the Noachian period. Exploring Krokodillen: A New Martian Frontier NASA's Perseverance rover has started exploring a brand new area on Mars called ""Krokodillen,"" and scientists are excited. This rocky region might hold some of the oldest rocks ever found on the Red Planet. It's located at a key boundary between the rugged rim of Jezero Crater and the plains beyond, making it a prime spot for unlocking secrets about Mars' distant past. ""The last five months have been a geologic whirlwind,"" said Ken Farley, deputy project scientist for Perseverance from Caltech in Pasadena. ""As successful as our exploration of ""Witch Hazel Hill"" has been, our investigation of Krokodillen promises to be just as compelling."" Krokodillen is named after a mountain ridge in Norway and means ""the crocodile"" in Norwegian. It stretches across 73 acres of rocky terrain and sits just downslope from Witch Hazel Hill. But what makes this place truly special is what's hidden in the rocks. Krokodillen's Ancient Clays: Traces of Water and Life Early findings show that clay minerals are present in Krokodillen's bedrock. That's a big deal because clays only form in the presence of liquid water, which means this area may have been wet billions of years ago. (This was likely before Jezero Crater was formed by the impact of an asteroid.) On Earth, clay is also excellent at preserving organic compounds-the chemical building blocks of life. ""If we find a potential biosignature here, it would most likely be from an entirely different and much earlier epoch of Mars evolution than the one we found last year in the crater with Cheyava Falls,'"" said Farley, referring to a rock sampled in July 2024 with chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by life long ago. ""The Krokodillen rocks formed before Jezero Crater was created, during Mars' earliest geologic period, the Noachian, and are among the oldest rocks on Mars. NASA program scientist Lindsay Hays explains what defines potential signs of ancient life on other worlds and why they require future study. NASA's Perseverance Mars rover is searching for these signs, collecting samples for future return to Earth, and helping pave the way for human exploration. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Carbonates and Olivine: Martian Rock Chemistry Data collected from NASA's Mars orbiters suggest that the outer edges of Krokodillen may also have areas rich in olivine and carbonate. While olivine forms from magma, carbonate minerals on Earth typically form during a reaction in liquid water between rock and dissolved carbon dioxide. Carbonate minerals on Earth are known to be excellent preservers of fossilized ancient microbial life and recorders of ancient climate. The rover, which celebrated its 1,500th day of surface operations on May 9, is currently analyzing a rocky outcrop in Krokodillen called ""Copper Cove"" that may contain Noachian rocks. The rover's arrival at Krokodillen comes with a new sampling strategy for the nuclear-powered rover that allows for leaving some cored samples unsealed in case the mission finds a more scientifically compelling geologic feature down the road. Bell Island and the Case of the Unsealed Tube To date, Perseverance has collected and sealed two regolith (crushed rock and dust) samples, three witness tubes, and one atmospheric sample. It has also collected 26 rock cores and sealed 25 of them. The rover's one unsealed sample is its most recent, a rock core taken on April 28 that the team named ""Bell Island,"" which contains small round stones called spherules. If at some point the science team decides a new sample should take its place, the rover could be commanded to remove the tube from its bin in storage and dump the previous sample. ""We have been exploring Mars for over four years, and every single filled sample tube we have on board has its own unique and compelling story to tell,"" said Perseverance acting project scientist Katie Stack Morgan of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. ""There are seven empty sample tubes remaining and a lot of open road in front of us, so we're going to keep a few tubes - including the one containing the Bell Island core - unsealed for now. This strategy allows us maximum flexibility as we continue our collection of diverse and compelling rock samples."" Clean Enough: Safeguarding Sample Integrity Before the mission adopted its new strategy, the engineering sample team assessed whether leaving a tube unsealed could diminish the quality of a sample. The answer was no. ""The environment inside the rover met very strict standards for cleanliness when the rover was built. The tube is also oriented in such a way within its individual storage bin that the likelihood of extraneous material entering the tube during future activities, including sampling and drives, is very low,"" said Stack Morgan. In addition, the team assessed whether remnants of a sample that was dumped could ""contaminate"" a later sample. ""Although there is a chance that any material remaining in the tube from the previous sample could come in contact with the outside of a new sample,"" said Stack Morgan, ""it is a very minor concern - and a worthwhile exchange for the opportunity to collect the best and most compelling samples when we find them."" Perseverance is NASA's most advanced Mars rover, designed to explore the surface of the Red Planet and search for signs of ancient life. It launched on July 30, 2020, and successfully landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. Equipped with cutting-edge scientific instruments, Perseverance is investigating Mars' geology, climate, and past habitability. A major goal is to collect and cache rock and soil samples that may one day be returned to Earth by a future mission. The rover also carries Ingenuity, a small experimental helicopter that made history by performing the first powered flight on another planet.

Humanity's ability to image the heavens has improved by leaps and bounds since the invention of the telescope in 1608. Although the earliest of these images were far from clear, astronomers from generations ago could already observe craters on our moon, identify four of Jupiter's moons, and reveal a diffuse ribbon of light arching across the sky - what we now know represents the Milky Way's structure. But modern telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), have really brought the field forward. For instance, telescopes these days rely on very sophisticated instruments called coronagraphs to observe light coming from objects orbiting bright stars. ""Current leading coronagraphs, such as the vortex and PIAA coronagraphs, are ingenious designs,"" Nico Deshler, a Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona and co-author of the new study, told Space.com. ""A coronagraph is an instrument used in astronomy to block or suppress the light coming from a very bright object, like a star, to reveal fainter objects surrounding it."" This allows scientists to detect objects more than a billion times fainter than the stars they orbit. However, Deshler and his colleagues believe they can push coronagraphs further to capture direct images of distant worlds. ""Our team is broadly interested in the fundamental limits of sensing and metrology imposed by quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of imaging applications,"" Itay Ozer, a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland and another of the study's co-authors, told Space.com. The idea is to use principles of quantum mechanics to surpass the resolution limits of current telescopes, allowing scientists to image objects smaller or closer together than what traditional optics would permit. ""The resolution of a telescope generally describes the smallest feature that the telescope can faithfully capture,"" said Ozer. ""This smallest length scale, dubbed the 'diffraction limit,' is related to the wavelength of the detected light divided by the diameter of the telescope.""

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors This means gaining higher resolution requires building larger telescopes. However, launching a telescope large enough to surpass the diffraction limit necessary to directly image an exoplanet poses different types of challenges: high launch costs and extreme engineering complexity. ""In this regard, developing sub-diffraction imaging methods is an important pursuit because it allows us to expand the domain of accessible exoplanets given the challenges and constraints associated with space-based observation,"" added Deshler. ""We were inspired to explore the implications of these newfound quantum information-theoretic limits in the context of sub-diffraction exoplanet imaging where many Earth-like exoplanets are suspected to reside."" The team thus designed a ""quantum-level"" coronagraph that can sort the light collected by a telescope and isolate the faint signal from exoplanets - light that is usually overwhelmed by the glare of their host stars. The concept relies on the fact that photons, or particles of light, travel in different patterns known as spatial modes. ""In astronomical imaging, the position of each light source in the field of view of a telescope excites different optical spatial modes,"" explained Ozer. By using an optical device called a ""spatial mode sorter,"" which is a cascade of carefully designed diffractive phase masks, the team was able to separate the incoming light, allowing them to isolate photons coming specifically from the exoplanet below the sub-diffraction limit. ""As light interacts with each mask and propagates downstream through the mode sorter,"" said Deshler, ""the optical field interferes with itself in such a way that the photons in each spatial mode get physically routed to different non-overlapping regions of space."" ""The correspondence between the positions of light sources and their corresponding excited spatial modes is central to [...] nulling of starlight and detection of exoplanets,"" added Ozer. ""In this way, we are able to siphon the photons emitted by the star away from the photons emitted by the exoplanet."" Starlight falling on an exoplanet. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech) This goes beyond digitally processing an image and subtracts starlight after the fact - in other words, it removes starlight in the optical domain before the light even reaches a detector. ""In exoplanet searches, a telescope is rotated to point directly at a prospective star, which we model as a point source of light,"" explained Deshler. ""Under this alignment between the star and the telescope axis, all the photons emanating from the star couple to the [telescope's] fundamental mode - the specific spatial mode that is excited when looking at an on-axis point source."" Under this alignment, all the photons emanating from the star couple to the fundamental mode. By filtering out this mode, Deshler, Ozer and their colleagues were able to effectively eliminate the starlight, revealing only the light from the exoplanet. ""The exoplanet's light is misaligned to the telescope axis, and excites a different spatial mode from the star,"" said Ozer. ""Our method preserves as much of the pristine uncontaminated photons from the exoplanet as possible, which turn out to carry all the available information."" In the lab, the team set out to show that their device could detect exoplanets positioned extremely close to their host stars - closer than traditional resolution limits allow. They tested it using two points of light: a bright one to represent the star and a much dimmer one to simulate an exoplanet. By gradually moving the dimmer light and recording the resulting images, they assessed how well the device could localize the exoplanet. They found that when the artificial exoplanet was very close to the star - less than one-tenth the separation limit of current telescopes - most of its photons were filtered out along with the starlight. At larger separations, however, the exoplanet's signal became clearer, rising above background noise and aligning with theoretical predictions. Additionally, by setting the star to be 1,000 times brighter than the planet and analyzing the images with a maximum likelihood estimator, the team achieved results within a few percent of the theoretical limit across a wide range of sub-diffraction planet positions. ""This is a proof-of-principle demonstration that spatial mode sorting coronagraphs may provide access to deeply sub-diffraction exoplanets which lie beyond reach for current state-of-the-art systems,"" said Deshler. ""We are hopeful that this method might allow astronomers to push the boundaries of exoplanets accessible with direct imaging."" The team says the technology needed to build and implement their quantum-optimized coronagraph already exists. They're now working to refine the device into a deployable system that meets performance targets. ""The main limitation is the fidelity of the mode sorter,"" explained Ozer. ""In the lab, we measure the 'purity' of the modes through a metric called the cross-talk matrix, which describes the undesired photon leakage that occurs between independent modes. Cross-talk is largely induced by manufacturing imperfections and small experimental misalignments. To successfully image Exo-Earths, [...] the mode sorter must isolate each photon in the fundamental mode to better than one part in a billion if the exoplanet is to be resolved."" The team says precision manufacturing is necessary to fabricate high-quality phase masks that can meet these ""cross-talk"" requirements. ""We envision the use of advanced techniques, such as photolithography, additive manufacturing, or micromachining, to construct extremely precise diffractive surfaces,"" Deshler said. The duo hopes this technology will one day provide complementary data for future flagship telescope missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory, a proposed successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, the JWST, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. ""Direct imaging is one of the few observation strategies that can measure the wavelength spectrum of an exoplanet,"" explained Ozer. ""In turn this spectrum may contain clues about atmospheric composition of an exoplanet and reveal potential chemical biosignatures."" ""We imagine that mode-sorter driven coronagraphs could augment the astronomy toolkit and enable better characterization of sub-diffraction exoplanets,"" added Deshler. ""However, the difficulty of exoplanet discovery warrants cross-validation with a multiplicity of observational techniques such as transits, velocimetry, and gravitational microlensing. Therefore, this technology is by no means a one-size-fits-all solution."" The study was published on April 22 in the journal Optica."

Prepare, then, to have your mind blown - the Solar System's biggest planet was once even bigger. New calculations suggest that early Jupiter could have had as much as 2.5 times its volume today, say astronomers Konstantin Batygin from Caltech and Fred Adams of the University of Michigan. Based on their study of two of the moons of Jupiter, the scientists have found that, just 3.8 million years after the first solid materials formed in the Solar System, Jupiter was 2 to 2.5 times its current volume, with a significantly more powerful magnetic field to boot. This is a finding that supports the bottom-up method of planet formation for the giant gas-shrouded world. ""Our ultimate goal is to understand where we come from, and pinning down the early phases of planet formation is essential to solving the puzzle,"" Batygin says. ""This brings us closer to understanding how not only Jupiter but the entire Solar System took shape."" We believe that rocky worlds, like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, form from the bottom up, a gradual accumulation of dust and rocks to eventually build an entire world, with a differentiated core and all. This is known as core accretion. Gas giants are thought to start out the same way, but once they reach a certain mass, around 10 times the mass of Earth, they have enough gravity to retain a substantial gas envelope, and begin to accumulate that, too. This process is thought to have taken place in the outer Solar System, since there wouldn't be enough material closer to the Sun to accumulate the large core. Since the formation and evolution of Jupiter is thought to have played a key role in the formation and evolution of the architecture of the Solar System, the details of how it was born and how it grew are of intense interest to planetary scientists. Since we can't just, you know, rewind the Solar System though, we need to look at what's happening now to try and reconstruct the past. Typically, this involves using standard models of planet formation collected from observing planetary systems (including our own) throughout the Milky Way and constructing a model based on those observations. These models, however, involve a lot of guesswork and connecting the dots, and as such, tend to leave significant uncertainties. Batygin and Adams took a different approach: they studied the orbital motions of Amalthea and Thebe, two tiny Jovian moons that orbit close to the planet, closer even than the orbit of Io. The orbits of these tiny moons are tilted with respect to Jupiter's equator. These tilts, previous work has shown, can be used to back-trace the orbital history of these tiny moons. Batygin and Adams used that orbital history to reconstruct the early evolution of Jupiter. ""It's astonishing that even after 4.5 billion years,"" Adams says, ""enough clues remain to let us reconstruct Jupiter's physical state at the dawn of its existence."" Their results showed that Jupiter had a period of rapid, intense growth early in the history of the Solar System. Just 3.8 million years after the first solids emerged, Jupiter's volume was at least twice its current volume. Moreover, its magnetic field was 50 times higher than it is now, facilitating a rate of accretion from a disk of material feeding into the planet of around 1.2 to 2.4 Jupiter masses per million years. This rapid growth phase developed the planet and put it on the path to becoming the Jupiter we see today. When the material around Jupiter eventually dissipated, the planet itself contracted under its own gravity, reducing its volume, and increasing its spin speed. Jupiter continues to shrink to this day as its surface and internal temperatures fall, compressing and heating its core and thus losing energy, although this occurs at a very slow rate. Even with a larger volume, Jupiter was never close to massive enough to achieve star status. It would need to be at least 85 times its current mass to be able to ignite core hydrogen fusion, a defining feature of all stars. What the team's work gives us is a new tool for understanding Jupiter and its role in the Solar System, where it is thought to have played a vital part in stabilizing the planets enough so that life could emerge on Earth. ""What we've established here is a valuable benchmark,"" Batygin says. ""A point from which we can more confidently reconstruct the evolution of our Solar System."" The research has been published in Nature Astronomy."

Whether it's a child eyeing a cookie or a sea creature hovering above a crab, the tug between ""now"" and ""later"" shapes daily choices. Across species, holding off for a better payoff often pairs with sharper thinking and long-term success. Scientists have tracked this link for decades in humans and chimpanzees, yet evidence in animals without fur or feathers has been thin. A new study puts cuttlefish at center stage with the famous ""marshmallow test,"" and shows that these soft-bodied hunters can summon patience - and brainpower - to rival some of the flashiest vertebrates. Patience, marshmallows, and cuttlefish Self-control is the mental brake that lets an individual pass up an immediate bite for a bigger meal down the road. In people, stronger self-control predicts better grades, steadier income, and healthier habits. Among animals, apes, parrots, and crows often wait, while monkeys, rats, and pigeons seldom do. Biologists think the variation reflects how each species makes a living. Lifespan, growth rate, and food supply all shape patience. Long-lived creatures can afford to wait, and social animals may hold back until a partner arrives. Predators stalking elusive prey, from ravens to reef fish, also do well to bide their time. Untangling which factor matters most is tough because many well-studied vertebrates share several of those traits. Undersea cuttlefish marshmallow test The famous marshmallow test gave preschoolers one marshmallow right away or two if they waited 15 minutes. To translate that setup underwater, the team offered hungry cuttlefish a piece of ordinary shrimp and, behind a clear barrier, a tastier live grass shrimp. Sliding doors let each animal see both treats while controlling when each became reachable. Some cuttlefish snatched the plain snack at once. Others hovered, watched, and resisted for more than two minutes, choosing the better catch when the moment came. Individual wait times ranged from 50 to 130 seconds, figures that match those reported for parrots and crows despite the cephalopods' far shorter lifespan. How did they perform? The work comes from lead author Alexandra Schnell of the University of Cambridge, who collaborated with Marine Biological Laboratory senior scientist Roger Hanlon and colleagues. ""We used an adapted version of the Stanford marshmallow test, where children were given a choice of taking an immediate reward (1 marshmallow) or waiting to earn a delayed but better reward (2 marshmallows),"" Schnell explained. The cuttlefish that participated in the marshmallow study were able to wait for the better reward, tolerating delays of up to 50-130 seconds. This is comparable to what we see in large-brained vertebrates such as chimpanzees, crows, and parrots. Patience alone would be interesting, yet the researchers also asked whether it linked to learning ability. They trained each animal to match a colored mark on the tank wall with food, then reversed the rule so the reward switched colors. ""The cuttlefish that were quickest at learning both of those associations were better at exerting self-control,"" Schnell continued. Patience pays off Reversal learning tests mental flexibility because an animal must suppress a habit and update its plan when conditions flip. In the study, individual cuttlefish that waited the longest in the marshmallow food test also adapted fastest when the color code changed. The pairing hints that the brain circuits holding an impulsive tentacle in check may also help rewrite memories on the fly. The findings appeared in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, marking the first documented link between delayed gratification and intelligence outside the primate lineage. For researchers, that pushes complex cognition deeper into the tree of life and invites fresh questions about how such abilities evolve among invertebrates. Why cuttlefish wait on the marshmallow Cuttlefish spend most of their time camouflaging, sitting and waiting, punctuated by brief periods of foraging. ""They break camouflage when they forage, so they are exposed to every predator in the ocean that wants to eat them,"" Schnell concluded. ""We speculate that delayed gratification may have evolved as a by-product of this, so the cuttlefish can optimize foraging by waiting to choose better-quality food."" That scenario fits their daily routine. A cuttlefish can blend its skin with pebbles or coral in less than a second, then freeze for hours. Every dash into open water risks a chase from cod, dolphins, or bigger cephalopods, so selecting the richest prey while exposed could boost energy intake without extra danger. Finding intelligence everywhere we look Octopuses and squids already headline stories for maze solving and coconut-shell shelter building, yet cuttlefish now join them as evidence that big brains are not the only route to sophisticated behavior. Similar challenges - avoiding predators while hunting nimble prey - can mold very different nervous systems into comparable solutions through convergent evolution. Self-control underpins planning, cooperation, and perhaps the roots of culture in vertebrates. Finding the same thread in a creature that last shared an ancestor with humans more than 500 million years ago suggests that patience is more than a moral virtue; it is a versatile strategy etched deep into the fabric of life.

The observation confirms the hypothesis that the terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, or TGFs, associated with lightning are the result of a powerful electrical field accelerating electrons to nearly the speed of light. In observations conducted in Kanazawa City in Japan's Ishikawa Prefecture, a team of researchers led by physicist Yuuki Wada of the University of Osaka used a cutting-edge, multi-sensor setup to capture colliding lightning in slow motion across multiple wavelengths. ""The ability to study extreme processes such as TGFs originating in lightning allows us to better understand the high-energy processes occurring in Earth's atmosphere,"" Wada explains. Although cloud-to-ground lightning formation is fast, it's not instantaneous, and requires a path to be cleared by a lightning leader. Air is naturally not very conductive, but the buildup of charge in the atmosphere as a result of storm activity can generate an ionized channel of air along which electric currents can flow. This is a lightning leader, and they can emerge downwards from the clouds, or upwards from the ground. TGFs are thought to be the result of the acceleration of electrons to near-light speeds in strong electric fields generated by thunderstorms. These cascades are known as relativistic runaway electron avalanches, and they're widely accepted as the explanation for TGFs. When the electrons decelerate suddenly, deflected by collisions with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere, the loss of energy manifests as gamma rays - a form of deceleration radiation known as bremsstrahlung radiation. The researchers set up a ground-based apparatus to monitor lightning across radio, optical, and high-energy wavelengths, able to capture details on microsecond timescales. Fascinatingly, their results showed that TGFs and lightning are not simultaneous; rather, the TGF occurs before the lightning bolt. But we're talking about absolutely minuscule increments of time; to our eyes, it would absolutely seem simultaneous. Only with state-of-the-art equipment can we see the reality. The team observed two lightning leaders, one negatively charged and streaking down from a thundercloud to a ground-based television broadcast tower, the other positively charged and snaking upwards from the tower. Just before the two oppositely charged leaders met, a highly concentrated electric field emerged between them, in which electrons were accelerated to relativistic speeds. The first gamma-ray photon was detected just 31 microseconds - 31 millionths of a second - before the leaders collided. The full TGF burst lasted until 20 microseconds after the leaders met to form the lightning strike. This is the first time scientists have observed and recorded this process, offering new and highly detailed insight into how lightning storms can produce enough energy to create gamma radiation - the most energetic form of light in the electromagnetic spectrum. ""The multi-sensor observations performed here are a world-first,"" says physicist Harufumi Tsuchiya of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. ""Although some mysteries remain, this technique has brought us closer to understanding the mechanism of these fascinating radiation bursts."" The research has been published in Science Advances."

It gives an idea of life expectancy on the Blue Planet. According to this study published in nature geoscience, one might have hoped for a spectacular end to life on Earth: a massive asteroid, an alien invasion, a rebellious artificial intelligence... Well, in practice, all this could happen one day, but it is not foreseeable. What is more likely, according to a study supported by NASA, is that life on Earth will die out quietly, asphyxiated by a lack of oxygen. Sad and tragic. Researchers at the University of Toho, Japan, have succeeded in simulating the future of our planet, and have come to a conclusion that is not so surprising when you think about it. And we can rest assured about one thing: when it happens, we won't be around to see it. A realistic but sad scenario The study's verdict is as clear as it is dated: in around a billion years' time, the Earth's atmosphere will no longer contain sufficient oxygen to support life as we know it. Why will this be? Quite simply because as the Sun ages, it will become hotter. So hot that it will gradually consume all the carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere. And without CO2, plants can no longer do their job of photosynthesis. This means that there will be no more oxygen in the atmosphere, and life will then become impossible on Earth. What's more, without oxygen, the ozone layer will also disappear, which means that the surface of the globe will be exposed to deadly solar radiation, if there is any life left to eradicate at that time. Atmospheric transformation will also lead to an increase in methane, which will further accelerate the process. This process will take time, lots of time. In concrete terms, the Earth will gradually turn into a global desert and return to the shape it had billions of years ago: that of a rocky planet with no life forms. Well, almost: only anaerobic micro-organisms would be able to survive on this desolate Earth. A scientific study with philosophical echoes According to the researchers, this process of atmospheric tilting could start in around 10,000 years. On the scale of a human lifetime, that's a very long time. But on a planetary scale, it's a millisecond. And once this process has started, the scientists are categorical: there will be no turning back, and the slow countdown to life on Earth can begin. This prediction reminds us of the extent to which life on Earth is a precious, fragile and temporary anomaly. It's a thought that humanity, with its tendency to live in the moment - as evidenced by the lack of global ecological consideration - doesn't often give itself. We now know that the time for life on Earth is running out, but that there are still a good billion years left to make the most of it. That is, provided we don't destroy it ourselves first..."

Several such fossils exist for Archaeopteryx - the earliest known bird - and now, a remarkable specimen that was off-limits to scientists for decades is offering previously unseen evidence about the first bird's ability to fly. Researchers have long wondered how Archaeopteryx took to the air while most of its feathered dinosaur cousins never left the ground, and some argued that Archaeopteryx was probably more of a glider than a true flier. The first fossils of this Jurassic winged wonder were found in southern Germany more than 160 years ago and are about 150 million years old; to date just 14 fossils have been discovered. But private collectors snapped up some of these rarities, isolating the fossils from scientific study and hobbling investigations into this pivotal moment in avian evolution. One such fossil was recently acquired by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History and has provided answers to the longstanding question about flight in Archaeopteryx. Researchers published a description of the pigeon-size specimen in the journal Nature on May 14, reporting that ultraviolet (UV) light and computed tomography (CT) scans had revealed soft tissues and structures never seen before in this ancient bird. The findings included feathers indicating that Archaeopteryx could achieve powered flight. While most Archaeopteryx fossil specimens ""are incomplete and crushed,"" this fossil was missing just one digit and remained unflattened by time, said lead study author Dr. Jingmai O'Connor, a paleontologist and associate curator of fossil reptiles at the Field Museum. ""The bones are just exquisitely preserved in 3D; you really don't see that in all the other specimens,"" O'Connor told CNN. ""We also have more fossilized soft tissues associated with our specimen than we've seen in any other individual."" Feathers for flight Field Museum fossil preparators and study coauthors Akiko Shinya and Constance Van Beek worked on the specimen for more than a year. They spent hundreds of hours scanning and modeling the positions of the bones in three dimensions; chipping away shards of limestone; and using UV light to illuminate the boundaries between mineralized soft tissue and rocky matrix. Their preparation - a process that took about 1,600 hours in all, O'Connor estimated - paid off. The researchers detected the first evidence in Archaeopteryx of a group of flight feathers called tertials, which grow along the humerus between the elbow and the body and are an important component of all powered flight in modern birds. Since the 1980s, scientists have hypothesized that Archaeopteryx had tertials due to the length of its humerus, O'Connor said. But this is the first time such feathers have been found in an Archaeopteryx fossil. The surprises didn't end there. Elongated scale shapes on the toe pads hinted that Archaeopteryx spent time foraging on the ground, as modern pigeons and doves do. And bones in the roof of its mouth provided clues about the evolution of a skull feature in birds called cranial kinesis, the independent movement of skull bones relative to each other. This feature gives birds more flexibility in how they use their beaks. ""It was one Wow!' after another,"" O'Connor said. The discovery of tertials in particular ""is an extraordinary finding because it suggests that Archaeopteryx could indeed fly,"" said Dr. Susan Chapman, an associate professor in the department of biological sciences at Clemson University in South Carolina. Chapman, who was not involved in the research, studies bird evolution using paleontology and developmental biology. ""The preparators of the Chicago Archaeopteryx did an outstanding job of preserving not just the bone structure, but also the soft tissue impressions,"" Chapman told CNN in an email. ""Because of their care, this near complete specimen provides never-before-understood insights into this transitional fossil from theropod dinosaurs to birds."" However, Archaeopteryx could probably only fly for short distances, she added. Despite having tertials, it lacked certain adaptations for powered flight seen in modern birds, such as specialized flight muscles and a breastbone extension called a keel to anchor those muscles, Chapman said. An evolutionary turning point The museum acquired this Archaeopteryx specimen in 2022, and at the time, museum president and CEO Julian Siggers called it ""the Field Museum's most significant fossil acquisition since SUE the T. rex."" As a link between non-avian theropod dinosaurs and the lineage that produced all modern birds, Archaeopteryx's evolutionary importance was unquestionable. But in some ways, the museum was taking a big gamble on that particular fossil, according to O'Connor. It had been in private hands since 1990, and its condition was unknown. When it arrived at the museum, scientists weren't sure what to expect, O'Connor said. To say that the fossil exceeded their expectations would be an understatement. ""When I found out we were going to acquire an Archaeopteryx, I never in my wildest dreams thought that we were going to end up with such a spectacular specimen,"" O'Connor said. ""This is one of the most important macroevolutionary transitions in Earth's life history, because this gives rise to the group of dinosaurs that not only survives the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, but then becomes the most diverse group of land vertebrates on our planet today. So this is a very, very important moment in evolution."" The significance of such specimens underscores why scientific access should be prioritized over private fossil collection, Chapman added. When fossils are sold for profit and private display rather than for study, ""their preparation is often poor, thus losing irreplaceable soft tissue structures,"" she said. ""Moreover, the value of such specimens to mankind's understanding of evolution is lost for decades."" The Chicago Archaeopteryx likely preserves many other important details about bird evolution, O'Connor added. With an abundance of data already collected from the fossil and analysis still underway, its full story is yet to be told. ""There's going to be a lot more to come,"" she said. ""I hope that everyone finds it as exciting as I do."" Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.

Speaking at the spring meeting of the Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium May 19, John Couluris, senior vice president of lunar permanence at Blue Origin, showed off a new illustration of a ""transporter"" vehicle that will support its Blue Moon Mark 2 lander. The transporter is part of the architecture that Blue Origin has said little about since winning a $3.4 billion award from NASA two years ago to build Blue Moon Mark 2 for the Human Landing System (HLS) program, although the company provided few details about it at the time. Originally, the transporter was going to be developed by other companies that were part of the Blue Origin-led ""National Team,"" but industry sources said that Blue Origin has since taken over development of the transporter. ""This vehicle has evolved significantly since we first won,"" he said of the transporter. The purpose of the vehicle remains to aggregate liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant in Earth orbit and then transport it to a near-rectilinear halo orbit around the moon, where it will transfer the propellants to the Blue Moon lander there to enable it to perform a lunar landing. The transporter will be launched into low Earth orbit on a New Glenn rocket and then fueled using excess propellant from New Glenn upper stages, although he did not disclose how many refuelings will be needed. It will use tanks seven meters in diameter, same as the upper stage. ""Instead of doing bespoke tanks for individual vehicles, it's using the same assembly line,"" he said. A key enabler for the system is ""zero-boiloff"" technology to prevent losses of cryogenic propellants. ""You always hear, wow, that's hard to do,' and it is hard to do,"" he said, but noted the company is making progress on that zero-boiloff technology that maintains liquid hydrogen at 20 kelvins - 20 degrees Celsius above absolute zero - and liquid oxygen at 90 kelvins. Working with NASA, Blue Origin has integrated its first prototype and put it in a thermal vacuum chamber. ""By June, we will be showing that we are consistently holding hydrogen and oxygen as storable propellants,"" he said. ""By December, we'll start our flight units."" Couluris argued that being able to store liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen for extended periods would be a breakthrough. That propellant combination has the highest performance of major chemical propulsion systems and can be obtained from water on the moon or other celestial bodies. A fully fueled transporter can carry about 100 metric tons from Earth orbit to lunar orbit, he said, with applications beyond the moon as well. ""This vehicle with minimal changes, mainly on comms, can bring up to 30 metric tons to Martian orbit,"" he said. ""It can open up the asteroid belt. This opens up the solar system."" He didn't offer schedules for testing the transporter or the Blue Moon Mark 2 lander. During a separate panel at the conference May 20, Jacki Cortese, Senior Director of Civil Space, senior director of civil space at Blue Origin, said the company expected to conduct both an uncrewed test landing of Blue Moon Mark 2 as well as a crewed landing before the end of the decade. Blue Origin's Blue Moon Mark 1 robotic lunar lander will fly to the moon by the end of 2025. Preparing Blue Moon Mark 1 Blue Origin is also working on the Blue Moon Mark 1, a robotic lander capable of placing up to three metric tons on the lunar surface. It uses some of the same technologies, such as the BE-7 engine, as the larger Mark 2 lander. Couluris confirmed at the conference that Blue Origin would fly the Blue Moon Mark 1 lander for the first time this year. The company received a task order through NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program last year to fly a camera payload on that mission. ""This will land this year on the south pole of the moon,"" he said of the Mark 1 lander. That lander is currently being assembled in a facility in Florida. ""The vehicle is getting ready to ship out of our factory in about six weeks,"" he said. ""We should be launching a few months after that."" Cortese said the lander will first go to NASA's Johnson Space Center for tests in a large thermal vacuum chamber there. It will then return to Florida for launch on a New Glenn, making a seven-day transit to the moon before landing. Blue Origin is building a second Blue Moon Mark 1 lander, about six to eight months behind the first. ""We're building intentionally now to get hardware-rich,"" Couluris said. If the first mission is not successful ""we'll learn from it, we'll learn from the objectives we succeeded in and the ones we didn't succeed in, and we'll incorporate those into the next vehicle."" Cortese said the work on Blue Moon is in a dedicated facility. ""We intend for it to be a production line capability,"" she said, but did not disclose the projected production rate for the lander. ""It was really important for us to procure all hardware for two Mark 1 missions years ago,"" she added, citing supply chain challenges. ""Ideally, we'll have a successful first mission of Mark 1, incorporate any findings and be able to fly again,"" she said. If it is not successful, ""we have another lander ready to go. That was something that was really important for us."""

That's two quadrillion watts in a single pulse. It's a flash so brief it lasts just 25 quintillionths of a second. At peak output, ZEUS briefly outshines the global electricity grid - by more than 100 times. But this isn't just about raw power. It's the beginning of a new era in ultrafast laser experiments with far-reaching possibilities. National lab with a shared mission Based at the University of Michigan, ZEUS - short for Zettawatt-Equivalent Ultrashort Pulse Laser System - just completed its first official experiment at this intense 2-petawatt level. The lab is part of the Gerard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science and is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). ""This milestone marks the beginning of experiments that move into unexplored territory for American high field science,"" said Karl Krushelnick, director of the center. As a user facility, ZEUS offers its capabilities to researchers across the U.S. and around the world. Teams can apply to conduct experiments through an independent selection process, making it a truly collaborative space for discovery. ZEUS laser is like no other ""One of the great things about ZEUS is it's not just one big laser hammer, but you can split the light into multiple beams,"" explained Franklin Dollar, a professor at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). Dollar's team is running the first user experiment at full strength. Their goal? To generate high-energy electron beams that are comparable to those from kilometer-long particle accelerators, using a device that fits in a room the size of a school gym. Dollar's experiment aims to hit energy levels five to ten times higher than ZEUS has ever produced before. Laser beams accelerate electrons The team uses two synchronized laser beams. One creates a guiding channel; the other accelerates electrons down that path. ""We aim to reach higher electron energies using two separate laser beams - one to form a guiding channel and the other to accelerate electrons through it,"" said Anatoly Maksimchuk, a University of Michigan research scientist leading the experimental setup. This process relies on plasma physics. The laser blasts into helium gas, transforming it into plasma - a soup of free electrons and ions. Electrons surf behind the laser pulse in a process known as wakefield acceleration. By extending the gas cell and reducing its density, electrons stay in the accelerating zone longer before overtaking the pulse. This allows them to reach much higher speeds. More ZEUS laser testing Later this year, ZEUS plans to run its signature test. Accelerated electrons will smash into a laser pulse coming from the opposite direction. In the electrons' reference frame, the laser's 3-petawatt pulse will appear a million times more powerful - hitting the ""zettawatt equivalent"" level that gives ZEUS its name. ""The fundamental research done at the NSF ZEUS facility has many possible applications, including better imaging methods for soft tissues and advancing the technology used to treat cancer and other diseases,"" explained Vyacheslav Lukin, program director at NSF. ""Scientists using the unique capabilities of ZEUS will expand the frontiers of human knowledge in new ways and provide new opportunities for American innovation and economic growth."" Small space, big power The ZEUS facility packs an incredible punch in a relatively small footprint. The laser starts as an infrared pulse, stretched out by diffraction gratings to reduce its intensity. It then passes through four stages of amplifiers. At its largest, the beam is 12 inches (30 centimeters) wide and several feet long. As it enters a vacuum chamber, another set of gratings compresses the beam into a disk only 8 microns thick, which is ten times thinner than paper. It's then focused down to less than a micron to achieve peak intensity. ""As a midscale-sized facility, we can operate more nimbly than large-scale facilities like particle accelerators or the National Ignition Facility,"" commented John Nees, a research scientist who leads ZEUS laser construction. ""This openness attracts new ideas from a broader community of scientists."" Building ZEUS hasn't been easy The journey to 2 petawatts hasn't been fast. A key challenge has been sourcing components - especially the titanium sapphire crystal at the heart of the final amplifier. At nearly 7 inches (18 centimeters) wide, it's one of only a few in the world. ""The crystal that we're going to get in the summer will get us to 3 petawatts, and it took four and a half years to manufacture,"" said Franko Bayer, ZEUS project manager. Even scaling up to 1 petawatt came with issues. The diffraction gratings darkened during tests, raising alarms. The team discovered the cause - carbon deposits from broken-down air molecules in the vacuum chamber - and developed a maintenance schedule to clean them between experiments. The ZEUS laser is just getting started Since opening in October 2023, ZEUS has already supported 11 experiments, and hosted 58 researchers from 22 institutions. There's still plenty of science to do with a 1 petawatt pulse while the team works steadily toward their 3-petawatt goal. This facility isn't just pushing boundaries. It's reshaping what's possible for high-powered laser research in the U.S. - and doing it with shared access and global collaboration at its core. Click here to watch a video of how ZEUS works...

This panoramic view, taken during the rover's 489th Martian day-also called a sol-offers both a visually stunning and scientifically valuable glimpse of the Martian twilight. A Close Look At The Martian Sunset Panorama The image was created using Spirit's Panoramic Camera (Pancam) with a combination of color filters at wavelengths of 750, 530, and 430 nanometers. These filters allowed the generation of a false-color mosaic that closely resembles what human eyes would perceive, although the colors appear slightly exaggerated. Notably, the bluish glow near the sun in the sky reflects what would be visible to a person standing on Mars. However, the farther parts of the sky show a deeper redness, an effect caused by the Pancam's infrared imaging capabilities. Because Mars orbits the sun at a greater distance than Earth, the sun appears about two-thirds the size it does from our planet. In the foreground of the image lies the rock outcrop named Jibsheet, a feature Spirit had been investigating for several weeks. The floor of Gusev crater extends into the distance, with the sun setting behind the crater's wall approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) away. Why Martian Sunsets Are Different From Earth's Martian sunsets are distinct from those on Earth for several reasons. On Mars, twilight lasts far longer than on Earth, sometimes for up to two hours before sunrise or after sunset. This extended twilight results from sunlight scattering around to the night side of the planet by abundant high-altitude dust suspended in the thin Martian atmosphere. This phenomenon is somewhat comparable to the occasional vivid sunrises and sunsets seen on Earth, which occur when tiny volcanic dust particles scatter sunlight high in the atmosphere. On the Red planet, however, the continuous presence of dust causes a persistent, extra-long twilight glow. Scientists Are Obsessed With Mars' Long Twilight The Mars Exploration Rover team occasionally commands the rover to capture sunset and twilight scenes to study how high dust particles extend into the Martian atmosphere. These observations also help scientists detect dust or ice clouds that can affect weather and climate patterns on Mars. By analyzing the color and brightness of the twilight glow, researchers gain valuable data about the properties of the Martian atmosphere, including the size and distribution of dust grains. Such information is critical for understanding atmospheric dynamics and planning future missions. The Spirit rover had been instructed to stay awake briefly after sending the day's data to the Mars Odyssey orbiter, allowing this unique image to be taken just as the sun dipped below the crater's horizon. This mosaic adds to the collection of sublime Martian scenes captured by Spirit."

This chemical shield is known as the human oxidation field, and scientists think it reacts quickly with molecules surrounding us, neutralizing some volatile compounds. A new study has found, however, that when perfume or lotion is applied to the skin, it can transform the air chemistry in its immediate vicinity, potentially sending toxic chemical byproducts wafting up our noses or sinking into our skin. ""Given that the human oxidation field influences the chemical composition of air in the breathing zone and close to the skin, it affects our intake of chemicals, which, in turn, affects human health,"" says Max Planck Institute atmospheric scientist Nora Zannoni and colleagues. Much is still unknown about the human oxidation field and how it impacts our health. It was only discovered in 2022, when a team led by several of the same scientists found that oil from the skin reacts with ozone pollutants in the air to form a field of hydroxyl (OH) radicals around the human body. OH radicals are sometimes described as an atmospheric 'detergent', because they can react with and neutralize a wide range of airborne pollutants. At the same time, it's possible that some of these chemical reactions may produce potentially dangerous byproducts right next to our skin and airways. Figuring out how the human oxidation field interacts with chemicals in our indoor and outdoor environments is a new field in health research. In the current study, four young adults sat in a temperature-controlled indoor environment, and scientists measured the chemicals around their body and in the air when they had and had not applied personal care products. When some participants had applied lotion just prior to entering, researchers noticed that two chemicals - phenoxyethanol and ethanol - drifted upward from the skin on 'thermal plumes', dispersing into the ambient air with body heat. The concentrations of these lotion chemicals around each participant continued to steadily rise, even a whole 10 minutes after their application. Concentrations near the nose, for instance, were 2.8 times higher than those in the ambient air. Then, researchers released ozone from an inlet in the floor below participants. Ozone is formed when sunlight interacts with volatile organic compounds, and while it exists at higher concentrations outdoors, it can seep into buildings, reacting with our skin oil to create a human oxidation field. The team found that body lotion reacted with the human oxidation field from head to toe, hampering ozone's generation of a key OH precursor, and reducing its concentration around participants by 34 percent. A similar result occurred when participants applied a fragrance to the backs of their hands before entering the controlled environment. Both ethanol and monoterpenes rose around the participants, with levels 10 times higher above the participants' heads than in the surrounding ambient air. These chemicals also reacted with the OH radicals surrounding the human body, reducing their concentrations in the oxidation field. ""This study has determined that the human oxidation field generated by people exposed to ozone indoors is substantially disrupted when personal care products are worn,"" write the authors. The team did not investigate the health effects, just the chemical changes surrounding the human body, but they are concerned by the volatile reactions happening around us. ""We need to rethink indoor chemistry in occupied spaces because the oxidation field we create will transform many of the chemicals in our immediate vicinity,"" said atmospheric chemist Jonathan Williams, project leader of the 2022 study that discovered the human oxidation field. ""OH can oxidize many more species than ozone, creating a multitude of products directly in our breathing zone with as yet unknown health impacts."" The study was published in Science Advances."

Launching just one kilogram into orbit can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and the expenses increase significantly for missions traveling beyond Earth's orbit, especially to the Moon or farther destinations. However, a new proposal by researchers from the University of Cambridge and Columbia University offers a promising alternative that could dramatically reduce these costs-a lunar space elevator, or ""spaceline."" Rethinking Space Travel with a Lunar Space Elevator Traditional rockets rely on burning vast amounts of fuel to generate thrust and break free from gravity's hold. This method demands carrying heavy propellant loads, which increases both complexity and cost. For decades, engineers have sought more efficient solutions, and among the ideas that stand out is the space elevator-a structure that would allow vehicles to climb into space along a cable, eliminating the need for fuel during ascent. While a space elevator attached to Earth would stretch over 42,000 kilometers beyond geostationary orbit, building such a cable remains impossible with today's materials because of the extreme tension forces involved. Even the strongest carbon-based polymers fall short in strength, keeping the concept grounded-until now. Researchers Zephyr Penoyre of Cambridge and Emily Sandford of Columbia propose a fresh approach: anchoring the cable on the Moon instead of Earth. This natural equilibrium reduces the tension in the cable, making it feasible to build with existing high-strength materials such as carbon polymers, including Zylon. Engineering the Spaceline with Today's Technology According to the study, the cable could extend from the Moon to Earth's geostationary orbit, with a diameter no larger than a pencil lead. The cost to construct this structure would be comparable to other large space missions, estimated at several billion dollars. Once operational, the spaceline could lower the fuel needed to reach the Moon to just one-third of current levels. The spaceline would also provide safe and reliable access to the Lagrange point, a region with unique properties beneficial for space operations. Unlike low Earth orbit, where tools and equipment tend to drift away quickly, objects at the Lagrange point remain nearby for extended periods. This region is relatively free of debris and meteoroids, reducing risks to spacecraft and missions. The Lagrange Point: Space's Best-Kept Secret for Building Tomorrow's Infrastructure Penoyre and Sandford envision the Lagrange point as a base camp for future space endeavors. Its stable environment could support a wide range of scientific projects, including space-based telescopes, particle accelerators, gravitational wave detectors, and power generation facilities. It could even serve as a launch hub for missions deeper into space. ""The Lagrange point has been mostly untouched by previous missions, and orbits passing through here are chaotic, greatly reducing the amount of meteoroids,"" the researchers note. This makes it an ideal location for building and maintaining space infrastructure. The spaceline would enable frequent and cost-effective travel between Earth, the Lagrange point, and the Moon. This connectivity could foster a permanent human presence in space, supporting both scientific research and commercial activities."

However, they are unsure exactly how large and how far away the ghostly orb is - or how it got its unusually symmetrical shape. The scientists named the object G305.4-2.2, or Telios - Greek for ""perfect."" Telios was spotted in radio images captured by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope in Western Australia for the Evolutionary Map of the Universe project. It is a supernova remnant (SNR) - an expanding cloud of gas and radiation left over from an exploded star . Most SNRs are at least vaguely spherical due to how supernovas explode outward in all directions, although some have more unorthodox shapes , as they dissipate over time or get bent out of shape by other explosions or stellar winds. However, it is rare to find remnants that appear to have almost no imperfections. The researchers described the SNR in a new study, uploaded May 7 to the pre-print server arXiv and accepted for future publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia. ""This object [Telios] displays a remarkable circular symmetry in shape, making it one of the most circular galactic SNRs known,"" the researchers wrote in the paper. Related: Rare quadruple supernova on our 'cosmic doorstep' will shine brighter than the moon when it blows up in 23 billion years Zoomed-out radio images show that Telios lies below the galactic plane (the top part of the graph with swirling dark patches). (Image credit: Filipovic et al. 2025, arXiv) Telios is also unusual for its extremely low brightness compared with most other SNRs, which suggests that it is either really young or really old. Based on its perfect shape, it is most likely to be the former because most SNRs lose their shape as they age, the researchers wrote.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors The low brightness makes it hard to determine Telios' distance from Earth, which also raises uncertainty about its size. The researchers believe it could be anywhere from 7,170 to 25,100 light-years from our planet, meaning it could span anywhere from 45.6 to 156.5 light-years across - dozens of times larger than our solar system. The object is located below the galactic plane - the disk of matter swirling around the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, where most objects in the galaxy, including the solar system, are situated. Its unusual location adds to the uncertainty about its distance and size. But despite being outside the galactic plane, Telios is still part of the Milky Way. A perfect sphere Orb-like SNRs are very rare. However, a handful have been discovered before in dwarf galaxies that orbit the Milky Way. These include SN1987A and MC SNR J0509-673 , located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC); and SNR J0624-6948 , which was discovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) earlier this year. Researchers think Telios was created via a Type Ia supernova. However, they cannot be sure. (Image credit: Filipovic et al. 2025, arXiv) There are two ways in which these perfect SNRs form: via a core-collapse supernova, where massive red giant stars implode, generating a shockwave that in turn pushes its matter outward; or via a Type Ia supernova, where smaller stars explode in much more violent explosions, which astronomers use to study some of cosmology's biggest mysteries . The researchers believe that a Type Ia supernova was the more likely origin for Telios because red giants are much less common outside the galactic plane. However, it is hard to tell for sure because they cannot identify the remnant's progenitor - the shriveled husk of the exploded star that usually lurks at the heart of SNRs. ""While we deem the Type Ia scenario the most likely, we note that no direct evidence is available to definitively confirm any scenario and new sensitive and high-resolution observations of this object are needed,"" the researchers wrote."

This rare find from the mysterious baenid family is rewriting the story of turtle evolution and unlocking secrets about the prehistoric world they once roamed. Rare Turtle Fossil Found Turtles have roamed the Earth for approximately 260 million years, predating even the dinosaurs. This longevity makes them valuable to scientists studying ancient ecosystems and environmental conditions. Brenton Adrian, a PhD student in evolutionary anthropology at Arizona State University, played a key role in identifying the fossil. Found in storage at the Arizona Museum of Natural History, the fossil dates to the Turonian stage of the Cretaceous period, about 90 million years ago. According to the study, the newly identified species was named Edowa zuniensis. The genus name ""Edowa"" means ""turtle"" in the language of the Zuni Indigenous peoples from western New Mexico and eastern Arizona, while ""zuniensis"" references the Zuni Basin where the fossil was discovered. This animal lived alongside notable dinosaurs such as Suskityrannus, a tyrannosauroid; Zuniceratops, a ceratopsian; and Nothronychus, a therizinosaur. The presence of these contemporaries highlights the diverse ecosystem of the time. Photo of the type specimen showing the fossilized turtle plastron. Credit: Cretaceous Research Fossil Details Reveal New Evolutionary Insights The fossil is notable for the preservation of both the carapace (top shell) and the plastron (bottom shell), which is rare. Baenid turtle shells are unique because their bones fuse without sutures, a feature that helps researchers understand how these turtles evolved. Adrian explained that the new species ""fills an enormous gap in our understanding of the evolution of this native group of turtles, and shows that advanced traits evolved significantly earlier and in a wider distribution than previously expected."" Trace fossils on the shell also tell a story of survival and hardship. The team identified evidence suggesting the turtle was attacked by a crocodile and later infected by ectoparasites, tiny organisms living on the shell. These marks offer a window into predator-prey dynamics and disease interactions from millions of years ago. Turtles as Ecological Indicators Unlike large carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus rex, which occupied a narrow ecological role as meat-eaters, turtles were highly adaptable. Adrian points out that turtles ""occupied every habitat that reptiles are able to fill for a very long time,"" making them excellent indicators of past environments and water quality. Also, the research team confirmed in a press release that ""The specimens were collected on federal lands under a permit from the Bureau of Land Management. These lands are also recognized as the traditional homelands of the Shiwinna (Zuni), Dine Bikeyah and Pueblo peoples."" Studying turtles like Edowa zuniensis allows scientists to better understand the ecosystems of the Cretaceous period and how they functioned. Currently, a first-year PhD student, Adrian focuses on predator-prey dynamics at fossil hominin sites in eastern Africa, bringing a broad perspective to his study of ancient reptiles."

SWOT measures the height of surface waters, including the ocean, and hundreds of thousands of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in the U.S. alone. NPS In a first, researchers from NASA and Virginia Tech used satellite data to measure the height and speed of potentially hazardous flood waves traveling down U.S. rivers. The three waves they tracked were likely caused by extreme rainfall and by a loosened ice jam. While there is currently no database that compiles satellite data on river flood waves, the new study highlights the potential of space-based observations to aid hydrologists and engineers, especially those working in communities along river networks with limited flood control structures such as levees and flood gates. Unlike ocean waves, which are ordinarily driven by wind and tides, and roll to shore at a steady clip, river waves (also called flood or flow waves) are temporary surges stretching tens to hundreds of miles. Typically caused by rainfall or seasonal snowmelt, they are essential to shuttling nutrients and organisms down a river. But they can also pose hazards: Extreme river waves triggered by a prolonged downpour or dam break can produce floods. ""Ocean waves are well known from surfing and sailing, but rivers are the arteries of the planet. We want to understand their dynamics,"" said Cedric David, a hydrologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and a coauthor of a new study published May 14 in Geophysical Research Letters. SWOT is depicted in orbit in this artist's concept, with sunlight glinting off one of its solar panels and both antennas of its key instrument - the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) - extended. The antennas collect data along a swath 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide on either side of the satellite. CNES Measuring Speed and Size To search for river waves for her doctoral research, lead author Hana Thurman of Virginia Tech turned to a spacecraft launched in 2022. The SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) satellite is a collaboration between NASA and the French space agency CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales). It is surveying the height of nearly all of Earth's surface waters, both fresh and salty, using its sensitive Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn). The instrument maps the elevation and width of water bodies by bouncing microwaves off the surface and timing how long the signal takes to return. ""In addition to monitoring total storage of waters in lakes and rivers, we zoom in on dynamics and impacts of water movement and change,"" said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, SWOT program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Thurman knew that SWOT has helped scientists track rising sea levels near the coast, spot tsunami slosh, and map the seafloor, but could she identify river height anomalies in the data indicating a wave on the move? She found that the mission had caught three clear examples of river waves, including one that arose abruptly on the Yellowstone River in Montana in April 2023. As the satellite passed overhead, it observed a 9.1-foot-tall (2.8-meter-tall) crest flowing toward the Missouri River in North Dakota. It was divided into a dramatic 6.8-mile-long (11-kilometer-long) peak followed by a more drawnout tail. These details are exciting to see from orbit and illustrate the KaRIn instrument's uniquely high spatial resolution, Thurman said. Sleuthing through optical Sentinel-2 imagery of the area, she determined that the wave likely resulted from an ice jam breaking apart upstream and releasing pent-up water. The other two river waves that Thurman and the team found were triggered by rainfall runoff. One, spotted by SWOT starting on Jan. 25, 2024, on the Colorado River south of Austin, Texas, was associated with the largest flood of the year on that section of river. Measuring over 30 feet (9 meters) tall and 166 miles (267 kilometers) long, it traveled around 3.5 feet (1.07 meters) per second for over 250 miles (400 kilometers) before discharging into Matagorda Bay. The other wave originated on the Ocmulgee River near Macon, Georgia, in March 2024. Measuring over 20 feet (6 meters) tall and extending more than 100 miles (165 kilometers), it traveled about a foot (0.33 meters) per second for more than 124 miles (200 kilometers). ""We're learning more about the shape and speed of flow waves, and how they change along long stretches of river,"" Thurman said. ""That could help us answer questions like, how fast could a flood get here and is infrastructure at risk?"" Complementary Observations Engineers and water managers measuring river waves have long relied on stream gauges, which record water height and estimate discharge at fixed points along a river. In the United States, stream gauge networks are maintained by agencies including the U.S. Geological Survey. They are sparser in other parts of the world. ""Satellite data is complementary because it can help fill in the gaps,"" said study supervisor George Allen, a hydrologist and remote sensing expert at Virginia Tech. If stream gauges are like toll booths clocking cars as they pass, SWOT is like a traffic helicopter taking snapshots of the highway. The wave speeds that SWOT helped determine were similar to those calculated using gauge data alone, Allen said, showing how the satellite could help monitor waves in river basins without gauges. Knowing where and why river waves develop can help scientists tracking changing flood patterns around the world. Orbiting Earth multiple times each day, SWOT is expected to observe some 55% of large-scale floods at some stage in their life cycle. ""If we see something in the data, we can say something,"" David said of SWOT's potential to flag dangerous floods in the making. ""For a long time, we've stood on the banks of our rivers, but we've never seen them like we are now."" More About SWOT The SWOT satellite was jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the UK Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, managed for the agency by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload, NASA provided the Ka-band radar interferometer (KaRIn) instrument, a GPS science receiver, a laser retroreflector, a two-beam microwave radiometer, and NASA instrument operations. The Doppler Orbitography and Radioposition Integrated by Satellite system, the dual frequency Poseidon altimeter (developed by Thales Alenia Space), the KaRIn radio-frequency subsystem (together with Thales Alenia Space and with support from the UK Space Agency), the satellite platform, and ground operations were provided by CNES.

The images, captured shortly before 4:30 a.m. on March 1, 2025, revealed what NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab called ""a hauntingly beautiful glimpse"" of the planet's mysterious moon Deimos, in long-exposure composite imagery. The stunning view was assembled from 16 images of the otherwise faintly glowing moon as it rose in the Martian pre-dawn sky. While the long-exposure images reveal a relatively clear look at the sky and surrounding landscape, visible conditions were almost entirely dark when Perseverance captured the photos. The Deimos Mystery Part of what fascinates scientists about Deimos is the debate over how it became one of the Red Planet's moons. A range of theories have proposed origin stories for the curious natural satellite, including the idea that it is an asteroid that became captured in orbit around Mars or that it may have accompanied the planet for much longer, having originated alongside the planet. Another possibility is that Deimos could have once been part of Mars but was dislodged during a massive meteor impact. This impact could have generated enough force to dislodge the object, which then took up residence in the Martian atmosphere. Some planetary scientists also consider whether Deimos could be one of the larger remnants left over from a protoplanetary disk that once encircled Mars. New observations of distant exoplanets offer clues about how they form from these swirling circumstellar disks. Initially discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall, Deimos is one of the smallest known moons in the solar system, clocking in at just 7.5 miles (about 12 kilometers) in width. It is also smaller than its sibling, Phobos, which has also been the subject of speculation by scientists for many odd characteristics. Also like its sibling, Deimos has an irregular shape, which may support the asteroid theory of its origin. The moon currently orbits approximately 14,600 miles (23,500 kilometers) above the Red Planet, completing each of its orbits in about 30 hours. Capturing a Martian Enigma NASA's Perseverance rover captured the image using its left navigation camera, with each snapshot in the sequence of 16 images lasting approximately 3.28 seconds. The composite image was assembled on board the rover before it was dispatched back to the Perseverance team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California. The final image comprises a 52-second total exposure. The photo shows digital ""noise"" in the form of pixelation and a light, hazy appearance resulting from the low-light conditions before Martian dawn. Although several other small points of brightness appear throughout the photo, only two of them-the stars Regulus and Algieba in the Leo constellation-are likely to be celestial bodies. Apart from camera artifacts from the low-light conditions at the time the photo was taken, JPL scientists considered whether some of the points of light seen in the photo could also be evidence of cosmic rays, which might have been revealed through the long exposure times in the images collected by Perseverance.

Well, if you liked its ridiculous dance moves-bobbing here, weaving there-you'll love the Wilson's Snipe, a slightly longer-legged relative with a similarly impressive jaunty shuffle. Jocelyn Anderson, a photographer who is a self-described ""big fan of birds"" was lucky enough to get this amazing footage of a Wilson's Snipe in action, dancing its little heart out while snarfling up some delicious invertebrates. Anderson explains what's going on: This bird bops when being watched by potential predators (in this case, people along the boardwalk.) The bird is saying through movement: I have plenty of energy and will fly away, so don't even try to catch me. Cornell University's CornellLab of Ornithology provides terrific information about Wilson's Snipe, which they describe as ""plump, long-billed birds"" that are ""among the most widespread shorebirds in North America."" Here's an overview of the ""chunky sandpiper"": This elusive bird sleeps much of the day, then feeds around dusk and dawn. They probe for insect larvae and other prey in marshes, bogs, along pond and river edges, and in other wet settings, using the sensory receptors at the tip of their long, straight bills to locate food. Despite their somewhat pudgy, unbalanced look, Wilson's Snipe are strong, fast flyers reaching speeds of more than 60 miles per hour. They also provide a plethora of fun facts about the bird-this is my favorite: Because a Wilson's Snipe's eyes are set far back on its head, it can see almost as well behind as in front and to the sides. This arrangement makes it difficult for a potential predator to sneak up on a feeding snipe-it almost literally has ""eyes in the back of its head."" What a cool (and cute!) bird-I'll definitely be on the lookout for one the next time I'm hanging around a wet or marshy setting!

(CREDIT: ScienceDirect) Life, in its quietest moments, glows gently-so subtly that it's invisible to your eyes but bright enough for science to detect. Recently, researchers from the University of Calgary and the National Research Council of Canada captured this mysterious biological glow, known scientifically as ultraweak photon emission (UPE). Their groundbreaking experiments revealed not just that life emits tiny amounts of light, but also how this glow fades sharply upon death, highlighting its potential as an innovative tool for understanding health, stress, and vitality. Glowing Evidence of Life Ultraweak photon emission, or biophoton emission, refers to very faint light produced by all living organisms-from plants and bacteria to humans. This emission is extremely subtle, involving just 10 to 1,000 photons per square centimeter every second. Graphical abstract: UPE imaging provides the possibility of non-invasive label-free imaging of vitality in animals and the responses of plants to stress. (CREDIT: The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters) For comparison, a common light bulb gives off billions upon billions of photons per second. Daniel Oblak, associate professor at the University of Calgary, clarifies, ""We metabolize; we give off light. That does not imply anything else than we're producing energy."" Although biophoton emission has intrigued scientists for decades, its exact origin and purpose remain somewhat elusive. Scientists generally believe that this glow results from chemical reactions within cells-particularly involving molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS). These molecules form naturally during metabolic processes, especially under stress or injury. When ROS interact with proteins or fats inside cells, electrons shift, releasing tiny bursts of light. Capturing Life's Subtle Glow To investigate biophoton emission clearly, researchers employed highly advanced imaging technology. Electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) and charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras-capable of detecting single photons-were used to observe living and dead mice, as well as plant leaves, under strictly controlled conditions. This approach eliminated interference from environmental light or heat. In their study, published online in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, four live mice were initially placed in complete darkness. Their faint glow was carefully recorded for an hour. After euthanasia, imaging continued for another hour, maintaining the animals' body temperature constant. The results were stark: while living, mice emitted significantly more photons, primarily from their skin, compared to after death. According to researcher Vahid Salari, after death, ""some organs still emit light, most likely from the liver,"" though this was less than 10 percent of the total emission observed when alive. Plants Illuminate Under Stress Similarly compelling results emerged from studies involving plants. Researchers tested leaves from thale cress and dwarf umbrella trees, subjecting them to stress through physical injury and chemical treatments. Injured areas consistently emitted brighter biophoton signals compared to untouched regions. Photon fluxes of BBR for UV-vis-NIR wavelengths at room temperature (T = 22 C) and body temperature (T = 37 C) along with the minimum spectral energy density of UPE (assuming a minimum photon flux of 10 photons cm-2 s-1) and the estimated spectral energy density of bioluminescence (assuming a minimum photon flux of 105 photons cm-2 s-1), which is limited to the visible spectrum. (CREDIT: The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters) Remarkably, when benzocaine-a common anesthetic-was applied to injured leaves, researchers observed the most intense biophoton emissions, even exceeding those produced by hydrogen peroxide, a known stimulator of ROS. This unexpected finding suggests that benzocaine interacts with cellular processes in a unique, yet unclear manner. Salari notes, ""We still don't know the main source. We have some speculation, like a sodium channel or the release of more reactive oxygen species."" Beyond Body Heat One common misconception researchers addressed was whether this glow simply represented body heat. Oblak clarified that body heat, known as blackbody radiation, emits mostly infrared light-quite different from UPE. This study's photons fell primarily in the visible range, clearly distinguishing them from ordinary thermal radiation.

(CREDIT: The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters) Future Potential in Medicine and Agriculture Though biophoton emission research is in its early stages, the findings hold tremendous promise. Since UPE correlates with metabolic and oxidative processes, it could serve as a non-invasive tool for early disease detection, including conditions like skin cancer. Additionally, it might help evaluate the health of transplant organs prior to surgery, potentially enhancing outcomes for patients. The agricultural implications are equally exciting. Farmers might soon use drones equipped with photon-detecting cameras to monitor crop health. By detecting stressed plants early through their emitted photons, agricultural management could become more precise and effective. Riskin highlights, ""It's completely plausible that you're going to have drones flying over fields measuring plant health."" Exploring Death and Vitality Despite the eerie nature of observing life's subtle glow fade after death, researchers emphasize that these findings aren't supernatural. Oblak reassures, ""There's a lot of metaphysical connotations to the glow, but it's not an energy field around us-it's biochemistry.""

(CREDIT: The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters) Understanding biophoton emission might redefine how scientists and medical experts measure health and vitality. The study's authors are optimistic but cautious, acknowledging that significant research remains before practical applications become widespread. ""Now that we know there's a signal,"" Riskin notes, ""we can create technologies to listen for that signal."" Life's glow, once a fringe curiosity, may soon illuminate our understanding of biological health in unprecedented ways. Note: The article above provided above by The Brighter Side of News."

About a decade ago, a new generation of weight-loss drugs promised a slimmer, healthier future. But there was a catch: while these medications helped shed fat, they also led to a loss of muscle mass. Now, scientists may be on the verge of a breakthrough. In a serendipitous discovery, Professor Atan Gross from the Weizmann Institute of Science and his team identified a protein in muscle cells called MTCH2, or ""Mitch"" for short, that plays a key role in metabolism. When they turned off the Mitch gene in mice, something amazing happened. The animals not only became resistant to obesity, but their endurance soared, all thanks to a significant boost in metabolic activity. Building on that success, Gross's team recently took the research a step further. In a new study published in The EMBO Journal, they found that switching off Mitch in human cells also sped up the burning of fats and carbohydrates. Even more exciting, it stopped new fat cells from forming altogether. Back in the mouse studies, the results were just as impressive. The mice didn't just avoid gaining weight. They actually developed more muscle fibers, which are known to consume lots of oxygen and improve stamina. These welcome changes led to improved performance in stress tests and heart function but left researchers facing a mystery: How does silencing the expression of a single protein ""inoculate"" the body against obesity and, at the same time, improve muscular endurance? The search for an answer led them to the power plants of the cell, the tiny mitochondria organelles responsible for producing energy and driving cellular metabolism. The Role of Mitochondria in Metabolism We can learn a lot about the mitochondria simply by observing their shape and distribution within the cell. These organelles can fuse together, forming an extensive network of power plants that are highly efficient producers of energy, or they can exist as separate organelles that are less efficient at generating energy. To overcome the decrease in efficiency, these separate organelles must use a variety of energy resources - such as fat, carbohydrates, and proteins - at a higher rate. Over the years, Gross's team in Weizmann's Immunology and Regenerative Biology Department discovered that in addition to regulating metabolism, Mitch is one of the key regulators governing mitochondrial fusion, which helps us to understand the findings in mice. But would silencing Mitch have similar results in humans? In the new study, the researchers, led by doctoral student Sabita Chourasia, examined what happens to human cells when the Mitch protein is deleted by means of genetic engineering. The scientists found that the mitochondrial network then collapses, the organelles separate, the efficiency of energy production declines - and the cell goes into a permanent state of energy deprivation. This might sound like a nightmare scenario, but sometimes the lack of energy and its inefficient production can be beneficial - as, for example, when the goal is to offset overeating or to stimulate the use of fat deposits and prevent the accumulation of fat. ""After deleting Mitch, we examined, every few hours, the effect that had on more than 100 substances taking part in metabolism in human cells,"" Chourasia explains. ""We saw an increase in cellular respiration, the process in which the cell produces energy from nutrients, such as carbohydrates and fats, using oxygen. This explains the increase in muscular endurance in previous experiments using mice."" Burning Fat, Not Just Calories To increase the rate of their respiration, cells need more nutrients, which serve as fuel in the energy production process. The researchers saw that the high demand for fuel caused the human cells from which they had deleted Mitch to ""burn"" more deposits of substances like fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Moreover, while regular cells use more carbohydrates and proteins, rather than fats, to produce energy, cells without Mitch rely largely on fat to produce energy and to grow. ""We discovered that deleting Mitch led to a major drop in fats in membranes,"" Gross explains. ""At the same time, we saw an increase in fatty substances used to produce energy, and we realized that the fat was being broken down from the membrane to be used as fuel. In other words, we showed that Mitch determines the fate of fat in human cells."" During the next stage of the study, the researchers discovered that Mitch's involvement in the accumulation of fat in the body goes even further. Since it was known that women with obesity have elevated levels of Mitch, the researchers postulated that this protein is vital not only for mitochondrial fusion but also for fat cell differentiation, in which progenitor cells accumulate fat and turn into mature fat cells. ""When we deleted Mitch from the progenitor cells, we discovered that the environment created in these cells was not conducive to the synthesis of new fats,"" Gross explains. ""Reducing the ability to synthesize membranes prevents the cells from growing, developing, and reaching the point where differentiation is possible. The process of fat accumulation requires a large amount of available energy, but in cells without Mitch, there is a shortage of energy. In addition, the expression of genes necessary for differentiation is suppressed, and there is a shortage of the substances vital for this process to occur. As a result, differentiation of new fat cells is reduced, along with fat accumulation."" In light of these promising findings, Gross's lab is currently working, in collaboration with Bina - the Weizmann Institute's translational research unit that identifies early-stage projects with applicative potential - on a comprehensive program to develop a novel small molecule that inhibits Mitch and may serve as an effective treatment for obesity. The program is being carried out in partnership with Yeda Research and Development Company, Weizmann's technology transfer arm.

The research by an international team of sea level and polar ice experts suggests that limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial temperature-the Paris climate agreement's target-isn't low enough to prevent a worst-case meltdown of Earth's polar ice sheets. A better target for maintaining a safe climate, at least for the long term, might be closer to 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, said Durham University geographer and glacier expert Chris Stokes, a co-author of the new paper. ""There have been a couple of quite high-profile papers recently, including a synthesis in Nature looking at safe planetary boundaries,"" he said. ""They made the argument that 1 degree Celsius is a better goal. And a couple of other papers have come out suggesting that we need a stricter temperature limit or a long-term goal. And I think the evidence is building towards that."" It's not a new argument, he said, noting that climate research predating the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 1990 already highlighted the high risks of more than 1 degree C of warming. ""Those studies were saying, We're warming. We really don't want to go past 1 degree. We really don't want to exceed 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide,'"" he said. ""Because we know what could happen looking at past warm periods, and at simple calculations of ice sheet mass balance. And you know, 30 years later, 40 years later, here we are seeing the problem."" Scientific calls for a more ambitious long-term climate goal are rising just as Earth's average global temperature has breached the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees C of warming over the pre-industrial level nearly every consecutive month for the past two years. Atmospheric carbon dioxide has reached a concentration of 430 ppm, a 50 percent increase over pre-industrial levels. But missing those goals doesn't diminish the importance of potentially revising the target, for which the Paris Agreement includes a review mechanism, Stokes said. Even if the global temperature overshoots the 1.5 degree mark, it's important to know for the long-term how much it would have to be lowered to return to a safe climate range. The new study focused on how melting polar ice masses drives sea level rise by combining evidence from past warm periods that were similar to the present, measurements of how much ice is being lost under the present level of warming and projections of how much ice would be lost at different warming levels over the next few centuries. This animation shows how global sea levels have risen more than 3.15 inches over the past three decades, which is like covering the U.S. in about 13 feet of water over that period. Credit: NASA/JPL Sea level rise of several inches per decade would likely overwhelm adaptation efforts by many coastal communities in the U.S., said co-author Andrea Dutton, a geoscientist and sea level expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""Coastal communities that are adapting to and preparing for future sea-level rise are largely adapting to the amount of sea-level rise that has already occurred,"" she said. In a best-case scenario, she added, they are preparing for sea level rise at the current rate of a few millimeters per year, while the research suggests that rate will double within decades. The last time atmospheric carbon dioxide was at a concentration similar to now was in the mid-Pliocene warm period, just over 3 million years ago, when average global sea level rose 35 to 70 feet higher than today over the course of thousands of years. But the current rate of warming is far faster than any other time identified in the geological record. How the ice sheets will respond to warming at that speed is not clear, but nearly every new study in the past few decades has shown changes in the Arctic happening faster than expected. The United States' ability to prepare for sea level rise is also profoundly threatened by the cuts to federal science agencies and staffing, Dutton said. The current cuts to science research, the retraction of funds already promised to communities through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the abandonment of the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment and changes to federal rules on air pollution ""collectively threaten our ability to project future sea-level rise, to prepare our communities and to mitigate climate change and stem the rate at which sea-level is rising,"" she said via email. Many researchers are working closely with coastal communities, but as federal grants continue to get cut, these collaborations will founder, she added. ""The ice sheets won't care what different political parties believe' about climate change,"" she said. ""Like it or not, they are simply at the mercy of rising temperatures.""

Donate Now The mass of ice lost from the polar ice sheets has quadrupled since the 1990s, and they are currently losing around 370 billion metric tons of ice per year, said co-author Jonathan Bamber, a physicist at the University of Bristol who focuses on studying how Earth's frozen regions interact with the rest of the climate system. ""We switched on some new technology 30 years ago, and we discovered that the ice sheets are responding with a large amplitude and rather rapidly,"" he said. The extent of the changes to the ice sheet are much greater than models had ever suggested they would be, he noted. ""That was a bit of a shock for the whole community."" Most of the climate models of the past three decades projected only about half as much melting as has actually been observed during that time, he said. That suggests the ""safe operating zone for humanity is about 350 ppm"" of atmospheric carbon dioxide, corresponding to about 1 degree C of warming. ""I think we've known for a long time that we're interfering with the climate system in a very dangerous way,"" he said. ""And one of the points of our paper is to demonstrate that one part of the climate system, the ice sheets, are showing some very disturbing signals right now."" Some of the most vulnerable places are far from any melting ice sheets, including Belize City, home to about 65,000 people, where just 3 feet of sea level rise would swamp 500 square miles of land. In some low-lying tropical regions around the equator, sea level is rising three times as fast as the global average. That's because the water is expanding as it warms, and as the ice sheets melt, their gravitational pull is reduced, allowing more water to flow away from the poles toward the equator. ""At low latitudes, it goes up more than the average,"" Bamber said. ""It's bad news for places like Bangladesh, India, Vietnam and the Nile Delta."" Global policymakers need to be more aware of the effects of a 1.5 degree C temperature increase, Ambassador Carlos Fuller, long-time climate negotiator for Belize, said of the new study. Belize already moved its capital inland, but its largest city will be inundated at just 1 meter of sea-level rise, he said. ""Findings such as these only sharpen the need to remain within the 1.5 degree Paris Agreement limit, or as close as possible, so we can return to lower temperatures and protect our coastal cities,"" Fuller said. While the new study is focused on ice sheets, Durham University's Stokes notes that recent research shows other parts of the Earth system are already at, or very near, tipping points that are irreversible on a timescale relevant to human civilizations. That includes changes to freshwater systems and ocean acidification. ""I think somebody used the analogy that it's like you're wandering around in a dark room,"" he said. ""You know there's a monster there, but you don't know when you're going to encounter it. It's a little bit like that with these tipping points. We don't know exactly where they are. We may have even crossed them, and we do know that we will hit them if we keep warming."" About This Story Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

A massive streak of white, aurora-like light recently appeared in the night sky above several U.S. states after a Chinese rocket released half a dozen satellites into orbit. The light show was triggered when the rocket dumped a new type of fuel into space before reentering the atmosphere, experts say. The luminous streak appeared at around 1:24 a.m. ET on Saturday (May 17), hanging in the air for around 10 minutes before eventually fading away. It was photographed in at least seven states - Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Missouri, Nebraska, Washington and New Mexico - but may have been visible even further afield, according to Spaceweather.com . Photographer Mike Lewinski snapped stunning shots of the streak from Crestone, Colorado (see above) and also managed to capture timelapse footage of the entire event. Meanwhile, photographer Jay Shaffer took a striking long-exposure photo of the streak in Taos County, New Mexico (see below). In some places, the streak appeared alongside auroras that emerged during a G2-class geomagnetic storm, which was triggered earlier in the night when a cloud of charged particles ejected by the sun, known as a coronal mass ejection , slammed into Earth's magnetic field. As a result, many people who witnessed the streak assumed it was the aurora-like phenomenon known as STEVE , which creates long colored ribbons of light in the night sky. However, what people actually saw was the aftermath of one of China's Zhuque-2E rockets, which launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China at around 12:12 a.m. ET, according to Space News . The rocket released six satellites, each carrying various scientific instruments, before it burned up in Earth's upper atmosphere upon reentry.

However, Jonathan McDowell , an astronomer at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who tracks satellite launches and reentries, later revealed on the social platform X that it was caused by a ""fuel dump"" at an altitude of around 155 miles (250 kilometers) before the rocket de-orbited. The ejected fuel, which trailed behind the rocket, froze into a ribbon of tiny frozen crystals that then reflected sunlight toward Earth's surface, making it shine in the night sky. The Zhuque-2E rocket lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center at around 12:12 a.m. ET. (Image credit: LandSpace) Similar light shows often occur when SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets dump their fuel before re-entering the atmosphere. In these cases, the spacecraft is normally spinning as it dumps the fuel, creating luminous whirlpools of light. Recent examples of these structures, nicknamed SpaceX spirals, include a luminous vortex spotted above the U.K. in March, a ""horned"" spiral that appeared over mainland Europe in May 2024 and a distant swirl visible from Hawaii in January 2023, among others. New type of rocket fuel The Zhuque-2E rocket is a single-use orbital launch vehicle created by Chinese company LandSpace. It stands at around 160 feet (50 meters) tall and can launch up to 13,200 pounds (6,000 kilograms) of payloads into low-Earth orbit (LEO) - the region of space up to 1,200 miles (2,000 km) above Earth's surface, where the majority of Earth-orbiting satellites operate . Unlike most rockets, which use hydrogen or kerosene-based fuels, Zhuque-2E uses a special hybrid of liquid oxygen and liquid methane, known as ""methalox."" In July 2023, the rocket's predecessor, Zhuque-2, became the first methane-fueled rocket to reach LEO , beating the likes of SpaceX, which also uses methalox fuels in its gigantic Starship rocket but is yet to successfully get the spacecraft into a full orbital flight . China has now successfully launched four methane-powered rockets into space."

Dozens of never-before-seen species of ""extremophile"" bacteria were hiding in a NASA clean room used to quarantine a Mars lander before it was successfully launched to the Red Planet more than 17 years ago, a new study reveals. Some of the hardy microbes may be capable of surviving the vacuum of space . However, there is no evidence that the spacecraft or Mars were contaminated. NASA's Phoenix Mars lander touched down on the Red Planet on May 25, 2008, and spent 161 days (156 Martian days) collecting a variety of data, before suddenly going offline. Around 10 months before arriving on Mars, the lander spent several days inside a clean room at the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, before being launched from neighboring Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (then known as Cape Canaveral Air Force Station) on Aug. 4, 2007, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com . Clean rooms are spaces where spacecraft and their payloads are quarantined before launches and upon reentry to Earth, in order to prevent environmental contamination by microbes and keep them free of potentially damaging particles, according to NASA . These spaces are sterilized, pressurized, constantly vacuumed and supplied with air via special filters that keep out 99.97% of all airborne particles. Anybody entering the room must wear an all-in-one ""bunny suit"" and have an air shower before entering. But all of these measures still can't keep everything out. When researchers reanalyzed samples collected from the Phoenix lander clean room before, during and after the spacecraft was quarantined there, they found DNA from 26 novel species of bacteria. The team reported their findings in a study published May 12 in the journal Microbiome . Related: Alien organisms could hitch a ride on our spacecraft and contaminate Earth, scientists warn The newly described species all have genes that allow them to survive in extreme environments, such as the vacuum of space. (Image credit: Schulz et al. 2025) Most of the newly described microbes displayed at least some characteristics that made them resistant to harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, pressures and levels of radiation. Some had genes associated with DNA repair, detoxification of harmful molecules, and improved metabolism, and may even be able to survive the vacuum of space, the researchers wrote.

Clean rooms have to be constantly cleaned to reduce the number of microbes in them. However, it is impossible to keep everything out. (Image credit: NASA) The newly described species made up just under a quarter of all the species identified in the room, most of which also had extremophile properties. This suggests spacecraft clean rooms could be an excellent place to search for more of these hardy microbes. Finding new extremophiles is important because it can help researchers predict what potential extraterrestrial microbes might look like and how we can prevent them from contaminating Earth. Some of them also produce substances, such as biofilms, that have potential applications in medicine, food preservation and biotechnologies."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: Dongchel Shin, a PhD candidate in mechanical engineering and the lead author of a new paper that demonstrates laser cooling of a centimeter-long torsional oscillator, works on an optical setup. Credit: Tony Pulsone/MechE One of the most profound open questions in modern physics is: ""Is gravity quantum?"" The other fundamental forces-electromagnetic, weak, and strong-have all been successfully described, but no complete and consistent quantum theory of gravity yet exists. ""Theoretical physicists have proposed many possible scenarios, from gravity being inherently classical to fully quantum, but the debate remains unresolved because we've never had a clear way to test gravity's quantum nature in the lab,"" says Dongchel Shin, a Ph.D. candidate in the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE). ""The key to answering this lies in preparing mechanical systems that are massive enough to feel gravity, yet quiet enough-quantum enough-to reveal how gravity interacts with them."" Shin, who is also a MathWorks Fellow, researches quantum and precision metrology platforms that probe fundamental physics and are designed to pave the way for future industrial technology. He is the lead author of a new paper that demonstrates laser cooling of a centimeter-long torsional oscillator. The open-access paper, ""Active laser cooling of a centimeter-scale torsional oscillator,"" was recently published in the journal Optica. Lasers have been routinely employed to cool down atomic gases since the 1980s, and have been used in the linear motion of nanoscale mechanical oscillators since around 2010. The new paper presents the first time this technique has been extended to torsional oscillators, which are key to a worldwide effort to study gravity using these systems. ""Torsion pendulums have been classical tools for gravity research since [Henry] Cavendish's famous experiment in 1798. They've been used to measure Newton's gravitational constant, G, test the inverse-square law, and search for new gravitational phenomena,"" explains Shin. By using lasers to remove nearly all thermal motion from atoms, in recent decades scientists have created ultracold atomic gases at micro- and nanokelvin temperatures. These systems now power the world's most precise clocks-optical lattice clocks-with timekeeping precision so high that they would gain or lose less than a second over the age of the universe. ""Historically, these two technologies developed separately-one in gravitational physics, the other in atomic and optical physics,"" says Shin. ""In our work, we bring them together. By applying laser cooling techniques originally developed for atoms to a centimeter-scale torsional oscillator, we try to bridge the classical and quantum worlds. This hybrid platform enables a new class of experiments-ones that could finally let us test whether gravity needs to be described by quantum theory."" The new paper demonstrates laser cooling of a centimeter-scale torsional oscillator from room temperature to a temperature of 10 millikelvins (1/1,000th of a kelvin) using a mirrored optical lever. ""An optical lever is a simple but powerful measurement technique: You shine a laser onto a mirror, and even a tiny tilt of the mirror causes the reflected beam to shift noticeably on a detector. This magnifies small angular motions into easily measurable signals,"" explains Shin, noting that while the premise is simple, the team faced challenges in practice.

""The laser beam itself can jitter slightly due to air currents, vibrations, or imperfections in the optics. These jitters can falsely appear as motion of the mirror, limiting our ability to measure true physical signals."" To overcome this, the team used the mirrored optical lever approach, which employs a second, mirrored version of the laser beam to cancel out the unwanted jitter. ""One beam interacts with the torsional oscillator, while the other reflects off a corner-cube mirror, reversing any jitter without picking up the oscillator's motion,"" Shin says. ""When the two beams are combined at the detector, the real signal from the oscillator is preserved, and the false motion from [the] laser jitter is canceled."" This approach reduced noise by a factor of a thousand, which allowed the researchers to detect motion with extreme precision, nearly 10 times better than the oscillator's own quantum zero-point fluctuations. ""That level of sensitivity made it possible for us to cool the system down to just 10 milli-kelvins using laser light,"" Shin says. Shin says this work is just the beginning. ""While we've achieved quantum-limited precision below the zero-point motion of the oscillator, reaching the actual quantum ground state remains our next goal,"" he says. ""To do that, we'll need to further strengthen the optical interaction-using an optical cavity that amplifies angular signals, or optical trapping strategies. These improvements could open the door to experiments where two such oscillators interact only through gravity, allowing us to directly test whether gravity is quantum or not."" The paper's other authors from the Department of Mechanical Engineering include Vivishek Sudhir, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and the Class of 1957 Career Development Professor, and Ph.D. candidate Dylan Fife. Additional authors are Tina Heyward and Rajesh Menon of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Utah. Shin and Fife are both members of Sudhir's lab, the Quantum and Precision Measurements Group. Shin says one thing he's come to appreciate through this work is the breadth of the challenge the team is tackling. ""Studying quantum aspects of gravity experimentally doesn't just require deep understanding of physics-relativity, quantum mechanics-but also demands hands-on expertise in system design, nanofabrication, optics, control, and electronics,"" he says. ""Having a background in mechanical engineering, which spans both the theoretical and practical aspects of physical systems, gave me the right perspective to navigate and contribute meaningfully across these diverse domains,"" says Shin. ""It's been incredibly rewarding to see how this broad training can help tackle one of the most fundamental questions in science.""

The findings, detailed in a study published in Science, come from a deep-sea drilling mission near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, close to an underwater mountain called the Atlantis Massif. This mission marks a milestone in direct sampling of the mantle-the vast rocky layer beneath the Earth's crust that constitutes 70 percent of the planet's mass and 84 percent of its volume. Despite the immense significance of the mantle in shaping Earth's geologic and tectonic processes, direct access to its materials has remained elusive until now. Breaking Through Boundaries: Drilling Into the Mantle's Depths The team aboard the JOIDES Resolution research vessel set out to drill cores from beneath the seafloor, targeting mantle rocks exposed by natural crustal thinning and faulting near the Lost City hydrothermal field. ""We had only planned to drill for 200 meters, because that was the deepest people had ever managed to drill in mantle rock,"" Johan Lissenberg, a petrologist at Cardiff University and co-author of the study, told Nature. Surprisingly, the drilling went three times faster than expected, allowing the team to extract a 1,268-meter core containing abyssal peridotites, primarily harzburgite, a type of mantle rock formed through partial melting. These rocks had undergone chemical alteration from seawater in a process called serpentinization, which changes the mineral composition and gives the rocks a distinctive green marble-like appearance. This successful drilling far exceeded the mission's initial goals, opening a new window into Earth's interior. Geological Significance of Mantle Sampling at the Atlantis Massif The recovered core offers a rare glimpse into the geologic substrate beneath the Lost City hydrothermal field, a site of intense scientific interest due to its unique chemistry and potential implications for the origins of life. The mantle rocks extracted provide evidence of complex interactions between seawater and mantle materials, helping scientists understand how hydrothermal fluids rich in hydrogen, methane, and other carbon compounds form in these settings. Andrew McCaig, a University of Leeds scientist and co-author, explained in The Conversation that the harzburgite and gabbros in the core reveal important details about the partial melting and magmatic processes operating beneath mid-ocean ridges. Such insights deepen our knowledge of Earth's tectonic activity and the dynamic processes shaping the oceanic lithosphere. Challenges and Future Prospects for Mantle Drilling Missions While this expedition represents a major step forward, the mission did not manage to fully cross the Mohorovicic discontinuity-the Moho-the boundary that defines the transition between Earth's crust and pristine mantle. Achieving this would require drilling through even thinner crustal sections or employing more advanced technologies. The current project ended partly due to limited operational windows and funding constraints, as the U.S. National Science Foundation declined to finance further drilling past 2024. The future of similar deep mantle drilling missions remains uncertain, despite their scientific value. Continued exploration near the Atlantis Massif or other thin crustal regions may eventually achieve the goal of reaching untouched mantle rock, offering even more comprehensive insights into Earth's structure and evolution."

Though alien in appearance, the moon shares unexpected similarities with Earth. It has clouds, rain, and even lakes - but instead of water, Titan's weather runs on methane. Thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope and the Keck II Telescope, scientists have now discovered evidence of methane clouds ascending in Titan's northern hemisphere. These latest images also detected a rare carbon-based molecule aloft in Titan's atmosphere. Combined, these findings give us a better view of the weather on this moon, and its complex chemistry. Summer clouds over Titan Researchers from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the W.M. Keck Observatory observed Titan in late 2022 and mid-2023. The team saw methane clouds forming in the mid and upper parts of the moon's northern hemisphere. This is Titan's summer season, and most of its lakes and seas are concentrated in this region. Methane on Titan works a lot like water does on Earth. It evaporates, rises through the atmosphere, condenses into clouds, and sometimes falls as rain. But there's one big difference: Titan's surface is cold enough to freeze water solid. The rain that falls there is oily and bitterly cold, and it lands on a surface where water ice is as hard as rock. ""Titan is the only other place in our solar system that has weather like Earth, in the sense that it has clouds and rainfall onto a surface,"" explained lead author Conor Nixon of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Tracking Titan's rising clouds The new images showed clouds moving upward over a period of days. This suggests that convection - the process of warm gases rising - is active in Titan's northern hemisphere. Until now, such motion had only been observed in the southern hemisphere. Most of Titan's lakes and seas are located in the north, covering an area roughly the size of the Great Lakes in North America. Scientists believe methane may be evaporating from these lakes, and fueling the clouds above. These images of Titan were taken by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope on July 11, 2023 (top row) and the ground-based W.M. Keck Observatories on July 14, 2023 (bottom row). They show methane clouds (denoted by the white arrows) appearing at different altitudes in Titan's northern hemisphere. Click image to enlarge. Credit: NASA/ESA On Earth, the troposphere - the lowest layer of the atmosphere - reaches about 7 miles (12 kilometers) high. On Titan, the same layer stretches up to around 27 miles (45 kilometers) because of the moon's low gravity. By using different infrared filters, Webb and Keck were able to peer into various layers of Titan's sky. They tracked the altitude of the clouds but did not directly observe any rainfall. Clues to life from Titan's weather Titan continues to draw interest from scientists because of its rich chemistry. It has many carbon-based molecules, which are essential to life. Understanding how these chemicals form on Titan may help explain how life began on Earth. Methane (CH4) is the starting point for most of this chemistry. When sunlight or charged particles hit the upper atmosphere, methane breaks apart. The fragments then rearrange and form new compounds like ethane (C2H6) and other more complex carbon molecules. Webb detects elusive molecule One of the most exciting results from the Webb observations was the detection of a short-lived substance called the methyl radical (CH 3 ). It forms when methane molecules are split and it is very reactive. Until now, scientists had seen the beginning and end products of chemical reactions on Titan, but not this middle step. ""For the first time, we can see the chemical cake while it's rising in the oven, instead of just the starting ingredients of flour and sugar, and then the final, iced cake,"" said co-author Stefanie Milam of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This new observation allows researchers to study chemical reactions as they happen in Titan's upper atmosphere. Titan's fate without methane Titan's chemistry may also give clues about its long-term future. When methane breaks apart, it doesn't all turn into useful new molecules. Some of the hydrogen escapes into space. Unless methane is somehow replenished from Titan's crust or deep interior, it will eventually disappear. Something similar happened to Mars. Water vapor broke apart, and the hydrogen drifted away. That process left behind a dry, dusty world. This four-panel infographic demonstrates a key chemical process believed to occur in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan. (1) Titan has a thick, nitrogen (N2) atmosphere that also contains methane (CH4). (2) Molecules known as methyl radicals (CH3) form when methane is broken apart by sunlight or energetic electrons from Saturn's magnetosphere. (3) It then recombines with other molecules or with itself to make substances like ethane (C2H6). (4) Methane, ethane, and other molecules condense and rain out of the atmosphere, forming lakes and seas on Titan's surface. Click image to enlarge.

Monitoring Tree Leaves From Space Could Help Predict Volcanic Eruptions - Gizmodo,science,"Carbon dioxide emissions from rising magma is one of the earliest signs that a volcano is waking up, but measuring it directly is notoriously difficult.",Margherita Bassi,Gizmodo.com,2025-05-21T14:30:44+00:00,"Forecasting volcanic eruptions is difficult, but not impossible.

By keeping an eye on features such as ground deformation, changes in gas emissions, and ground tremors, volcanologists can sometimes make successful predictions, which save countless lives. NASA and the Smithsonian Institution are now teaming up to monitor another volcanic harbinger, but from space: leaves. Scientists already knew that tree leaves can change color when a nearby volcano becomes more active, but this collaboration aims to observe the mechanism using satellite imagery. Given that there's no way to avoid volcanic eruptions, early warning systems are the only way to keep the public safe. ""Volcano early warning systems exist,"" Florian Schwandner, a volcanologist and chief of the Earth Science Division at NASA's Ames Research Center, said in a NASA statement announcing the collaboration. ""The aim here is to make them better and make them earlier."" As magma rises toward the surface of the Earth before an eruption, it releases gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. In fact, in 2017, a monitoring network at a volcano in the Philippines-which Schwandner and his colleagues had previously upgraded to read carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions-enabled government researchers to forecast a major volcanic eruption. Thanks to mass evacuations, no lives were lost. Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the earliest signs that a volcano is waking up, but they are difficult to spot directly from space. Why would we want to see carbon dioxide emissions from space? Because otherwise, volcanologists have to trek to volcanoes in person to measure them directly-a task that can be difficult, expensive, and even dangerous. ""Volcanoes emit a lot of carbon dioxide,"" said Robert Bogue, a volcanologist from McGill University. However, ""a volcano emitting the modest amounts of carbon dioxide that might presage an eruption isn't going to show up in satellite imagery,"" he explained. Carbon dioxide does show up, however, in trees' foliage, making it greener and more lush. As such, the NASA and Smithsonian collaboration is bringing together volcanologists, botanists, and climate scientists to investigate how researchers can use trees to monitor volcanic activity. ""The whole idea is to find something that we could measure instead of carbon dioxide directly,"" Bogue explained, ""to give us a proxy to detect changes in volcano emissions."" ""There are plenty of satellites we can use to do this kind of analysis,"" confirmed Nicole Guinn, a volcanologist from the University of Houston. Guinn has previously monitored trees near Italy's Mount Etna volcano using satellite imagery. The approach has constraints, however. For example, some volcanoes aren't close enough to trees for satellite images to be useful, and different trees can experience different responses to carbon dioxide. Furthermore, fires, weather events, and plant diseases can make satellite data difficult to interpret. But the truth is that no single feature can perfectly predict volcanic activity. ""There's not one signal from volcanoes that's a silver bullet,"" Schwandner said. ""And tracking the effects of volcanic carbon dioxide on trees will not be a silver bullet. But it will be something that could change the game."""

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.111.103033 When people think of black holes, they imagine something dramatic: a star exploding in space, collapsing in on itself, and forming a cosmic monster that eats everything around it. But what if black holes didn't always begin with a bang? What if, instead, they started quietly-growing inside stars, which still appear alive from the outside, without anyone noticing? Our recent astrophysical research, published in Physical Review D, suggests this could be happening-and the story is far stranger and more fascinating than we imagined. The mystery of tiny black holes Recent gravitational wave detections have hinted at the existence of near- and sub-solar-mass black holes-far lighter than those typically formed in stellar explosions. That's puzzling. According to standard models, stars that small shouldn't be able to collapse into black holes at all. So where are these low-mass black holes coming from? One intriguing theory suggests that these objects may originate from dark matter, which we still barely understand. This invisible substance permeates the cosmos, shaping galaxies with its gravity but eluding direct detection. Some researchers believe dark matter could slowly accumulate inside stars. Over long timescales, this buildup might trigger a quiet collapse-forming a tiny black hole at the heart of an otherwise normal-looking star. What happens next depends on the star. Once a black hole forms inside a star, it starts to grow, feeding on the surrounding matter. But how this growth proceeds-and what the end state is-depends crucially on the kind of star and, intriguingly, its spin. White dwarfs: Three fates hidden in the core White dwarfs are the dense, compact remnants of sun-like stars. Roughly Earth-sized but usually less than or slightly greater than the sun's mass, they resist further collapse through a delicate balance of quantum pressure. But if a black hole forms in their center, a hidden war begins. Here's where things get fascinating. The spin of the white dwarf-how fast it's rotating-plays a decisive role. Three possible outcomes have been proposed depending on its spin: Black hole formation: If the star spins slowly, matter around the core falls easily. The tiny black hole steadily grows, eventually consuming the whole star, and transmutes it to a low-mass black hole. Naked singularity formation: At certain intermediate spins, the collapse can overshoot the formation of an event horizon. The result? A naked singularity-a bare black hole that is not hidden behind a horizon. These objects challenge our understanding of physics and may expose the inner workings of gravity itself. This, in fact, is a new channel to form a near- and sub-solar-mass naked singularity itself. Stalled accretion-the hybrid star: If the white dwarf is rapidly spinning, the black hole's growth slows dramatically. Resistance from the star's rotation and viscosity stalls the accretion flow, leading to the formation of polar funnels, preventing full collapse. The black hole becomes a kind of parasite: quietly embedded within the white dwarf, feeding ever so slowly. This allows the white dwarf to survive with a small ""endoparasitic"" black hole (EBH) at its center. From the outside, the star may seem normal-but deep inside, a silent transformation is underway. The cartoon shows the basic idea of stalled accretion with conical openings-polar funnels. The shaded part represents the host body (white dwarf) and the black dot at the center depicts the endoparasitic black hole. Credit: H. A.

Neutron stars: The one-way path to a black hole Neutron stars are even denser than white dwarfs-so dense that a teaspoon of their matter would weigh a billion tons. The mass of a neutron star is usually greater than the sun's mass with a radius of around ten kilometers. If a tiny black hole forms even within a rapidly spinning neutron star, there's no ambiguity. The black hole grows rapidly, hollowing the neutron star from within. One day it's a neutron star; the next, a black hole-transmuted from the inside out, leaving only silence behind. Hidden in plain sight These hidden black holes may lurk inside stars, slowly growing, invisible until they leave subtle clues: strange gravitational signatures, unusual cooling behaviors, or disruptions in a binary orbit. Some of these black holes might remain entombed in their hosts for billions of years. Others might eventually consume their stars entirely and emerge as standalone black holes (or naked singularities)-long after their quiet birth. The galactic bulge-a football-shaped structure at the center of our galaxy-is believed to be rich in dark matter particles. The discovery of sub-solar-mass black holes and naked singularities in this region could suggest that they originated from the collapse or transmutation of white dwarfs. For the same reason, the predicted hybrid star-a white dwarf surviving with a small parasite black hole at its center-might also be found in this region. Listening to the silence This idea not only reframes stellar death-it opens up new ways to study dark matter. If these stealthy black holes really exist, they could act as natural detectors for dark matter's behavior inside stars. And if naked singularities are born this way, we might be witnessing violations of cosmic censorship-a foundational principle in general relativity. So next time you look at the night sky, remember: Not every star is what it seems. Some may be living out a secret story-peacefully glowing, while a black hole or something even stranger grows silently within.

This idea seemed too big and wild, yet it kept popping up in serious discussions of quantum mechanics where equations hinted at surprising behavior. A team led by Dr. Hussein Moussa from the Advanced Science Research Center at the CUNY Graduate Center (CUNY ASRC) in New York City has now confirmed that these mysterious events actually exist. They pulled off a successful test by changing the properties of a device in a quick, uniform way so that signals reversed direction in time. Understanding time mirrors This sort of time flip has been described as looking into a mirror and spotting your back instead of your face. It sounds like science fiction, but it has a basis in real physics. Researchers had predicted for more than 50 years that sudden shifts in a wave's environment could trigger such reversals. Time reflections differ from everyday mirror views in one crucial way. Instead of light or sound bouncing back in space, the wave is forced to reverse its flow in time. That shift causes the frequency of the wave to change, sparking a chain reaction of interesting phenomena in the system. In normal reflections, you see an immediate image or hear an echo. A time reflection, on the other hand, makes part of the signal run backward. There is no need for any speculation about time travel, though, since these effects involve a swift flip in the medium's physical traits. Time mirrors and metamaterials To achieve this, the group used an engineered metamaterial designed to control electromagnetic wave behavior in unusual ways. Metamaterials allow scientists to manipulate waves far beyond ordinary mirrors or lenses. By carefully adjusting electronic components on a strip of metal, they introduced a sudden jump that reversed the direction of incoming signals. They filled the strip with electronic switches hooked to capacitor banks. That arrangement supplied the necessary burst of energy to force the wave to flip direction in time, an effect that used to be considered nearly impossible with accessible power. The outcome was a time-reversed copy of the original wave, appearing just as predicted but never before seen with clarity. Adjusting the system's impedance at the right instant was key. Impedance is a measure of how much a structure resists electric current, and doubling it turned out to be the trick for flipping the wave in time. By pulling this off in a lab setting, they proved that the energy hurdle can be overcome when conditions are precisely controlled. Past attempts had failed because uniform shifts across the entire device were tough to generate, but the new approach surmounted that barrier. Why does any of this matter? This achievement signals a leap for people studying wave manipulation. Time reflections are no longer just hypothetical constructs but events that can be triggered and measured with specialized hardware. Some enthusiasts see this as a step toward advanced control of signals for communications and computing. A wave that can jump to a new frequency and then rewind might open new possibilities for data transmission at different ranges of the spectrum. It could also reshape how certain sensors and imaging systems are designed. The results also hint at potential ways to explore time boundaries in photonic devices. Future designs could pair multiple time interfaces together, creating ""cavities"" in time that bounce signals back and forth for unusual interference patterns. Such concepts might spark fresh ideas about how to engineer wave behaviors that were once locked in theory. Others consider these findings a reason to revisit older theories in physics that talk about reversing processes in time. Even though we are not dealing with a flux capacitor, the underlying math could illuminate unanswered questions about the flow of energy in complex materials. Next steps for time mirrors Physicists worldwide are eager to probe the limits of these time mirrors and see whether larger-scale applications might emerge. They would like to push the frequencies higher or adapt the technique to different wave types, such as acoustic or even spin waves. More experiments are bound to follow, especially since new versions of tunable structures keep appearing. Early projects focused on controlling electromagnetic properties in narrow bands, but broader setups might let signals take on an even wider range of frequencies. Some labs are eyeing ways to refine the switching process itself, ensuring the transformation is as uniform and abrupt as possible. One question involves harnessing time reversal effects to handle wave interference in a creative manner. Combining two or more interfaces in the right sequence might lead to wave signatures that display patterns never seen before in standard reflection setups. A few researchers also wonder how these techniques might tie into advanced memory or logic systems. If a wave can trace itself back, that might open a path to novel data storage elements, though making it practical remains a challenging task.

Fact Check: New “Complete” Chimp Genome Shows 14.9 Percent Difference from Human Genome - Evolution News,science,I suspect that this radical finding has implications — for human exceptionalism and more — that people will be discussing for a long time.,Casey Luskin,Discovery Institute,2025-05-21T13:23:50+00:00,"Image credit: Nathan Jacobson.

A groundbreaking paper in Nature reports the ""Complete sequencing of ape genomes,"" including the genomes for chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, Bornean orangutans, Sumatran orangutans, and siamangs. I noted this in an article here yesterday, reporting that an evolutionary icon - the famous ""1 percent difference"" between the human and chimp genomes, touted across the breadth of popular and other scientific writing and teaching - has fallen. The researchers, for whatever reason - I'm not a mind reader - chose to bury that remarkable finding in technical jargon in their Supplementary Data section. Now for more on the scientific details. You might be thinking, ""Hey, weren't these genomes sequenced long ago?"" The answer is yes but also no. Yes, we had sequenced genomes from these species in the past, but, as the paper explains, ""owing to the repetitive nature of ape genomes, complete assemblies have not been achieved. Current references lack sequence resolution of some of the most dynamic genomic regions, including regions corresponding to lineage-specific gene families."" Or, as an accompanying explainer article puts it: In the past, scientists had deciphered segments of non-human apes' genomes, but they had never managed to assemble a complete sequence for any species. In the current study, however, [Kateryna] Makova and her collaborators used advanced sequencing techniques and algorithms that allowed them to read long segments of DNA and assemble them into a sequence that stretched from one end of each chromosome to the other, without any gaps. ""This has never been done before,"" says Makova. In other words, the complete ape genomes were never fully sequenced. And they used the human genome as a reference sequence, which made the ape genomes look more human-like than they actually were. You Don't Believe Me? From the technical paper: Most previous genome-wide comparative studies of apes have been limited by the mapping of inferior assemblies to a higher quality human genome. Consequently, human reference biases were introduced. This is consistent with what the National Center for Biotechnology Information said in 2007 about an early draft of the chimp genome: Contigs were assembled using the human genome as a guide, and are therefore ""humanized"" in their construction. This is an important distinction, as some sequences, such as insertions, deletions, and gene duplications, may not be accurately represented by the current chimpanzee assembly. Thus, up until now, most versions of the chimp and other ape genomes were effectively ""humanized"" because they were ""assembled using the human genome as a guide."" This effectively makes them appear more similar to the human genome than they truly are. Can these new drafts of ape genomes help fix the problem? Problem Solved? Another explainer article in Nature seems to suggest that these ""complete"" drafts of the ape genomes will prove that they are less similar to the human genome than has been claimed: Shortly after the first human genome sequence was finalized in 2003, a chimpanzee assembly was released. This was followed by assemblies for other great apes, such as the gorilla, Sumatran orangutan and bonobo, and small apes that are less closely related to humans than are great apes. These genomes offered a valuable opportunity to catalogue the genetic differences that have accumulated during the evolution of apes, including changes that are unique to humans. But, because these initial releases were incomplete drafts, comparisons could be made only between properly resolved portions of the genome. These studies therefore focused only on relatively small differences, and excluded extremely repetitive sequences and large-scale structural differences, such as inversions and duplications of genomic sequences. [Emphasis added.] That last sentence seems to hint that previous comparisons between human and ape genomes ""only focused on relatively small differences"" and ""excluded"" the sections that entail ""large-scale structural differences."" The explainer article notes that this study has ""fully sequenced the genomes of six living ape species, enabling long-awaited comparisons of hard-to-assemble genomic regions."" Thus, one could expect that these newly ""complete"" ape genomes would reveal much greater differences compared to the human genome. The New Ape Genomes and the Human Genome What's odd is that as one reads the technical paper, a direct comparison between the ape and the human genomes is hard to find. This passage seems to be as close as it gets: Overall, sequence comparisons among the complete ape genomes revealed greater divergence than previously estimated (Supplementary Notes III-IV). Indeed, 12.5-27.3% of an ape genome failed to align or was inconsistent with a simple one-to-one alignment, thereby introducing gaps. What exactly does this mean? Well, first they admit that ""sequence comparisons among the complete ape genomes revealed greater divergence than previously estimated."" But the technical Nature paper considers human beings to be an ""ape,"" so implicit in this statement is their belief that comparing ""ape genomes"" includes comparisons between human and ape (i.e., non-human hominoid) genomes. So for the rest of this article, I'll call humans ""humans"" and I'll refer to non-human hominoids as ""apes,"" just like most normal people do. Interestingly, two preprints of the paper (v1 and v2) published last year on BioRxiv (which are presumably the versions of the manuscript submitted to Nature initially and after one round of revisions) preface this result with these two sentences: The oft-quoted statistic of 99% sequence identity between chimpanzee and human holds for most of the genome when considering single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). However, comparisons of T2T genomes suggest a much more nuanced estimate. T2T means examining ""telomere to telomere"" - i.e., examining the entire chromosomes throughout the genome. These sentences were evidently removed during revisions for the published version in Nature - an interesting editorial decision. So what is the paper saying about the difference between humans and chimpanzees? As we'll see, the statement above - that ""sequence comparisons among the complete ape genomes revealed greater divergence than previously estimated"" - is true. But it doesn't reveal the extent of the differences between human and ape genomes that this study uncovered. So let me cut to the chase: Look back at those numbers, ""12.5-27.3%."" The same numbers show up again buried deep in the Supplemental Data where they compare various ape to human genomes. They're findable if you know where to look, but should I say ""buried"" - or ""hidden""? From what I can tell, the Supplemental Data reports that the ape genome that is most similar to the human genome is the chimpanzee genome. And it shows a 12.5 percent ""gap-divergence"" - i.e., difference - from the human genome! And when you look at the ""gap divergence"" where the human genome is the target and the chimp is the query, the difference is 13.3 percent. Let me be clear: According to this study, the human and chimp genomes aren't 98.8 percent the same (or 1.2 percent different) - as, for instance, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History claims (see my ""Visitor's Guide"" for more). In fact, they are no more than 87.5 percent similar - i.e., the human and chimp genomes are at least 12.5 percent different if not 13.3 percent different! In fact, the 13.3 percent difference is more relevant since this reflects how similar the whole human assembly is to the chimp genome. What Exactly is the ""Gap Divergence"" Before we go further, I want to explore exactly what the authors mean by ""gap divergence"" or ""gap difference."" The paper defines the ""gap divergence"" as follows: Gap divergence is defined as the fraction of positions in the target haplotype that are not aligned to the other haplotype, which could be due to biological processes (e.g., gene loss/gain and insertions/deletions), missing data, or technical problems (e.g., alignment failure due to SVs, repetitive elements, etc.). So how do they determine the gap divergence? From what I can tell, it's based upon dividing the target genome within the genome alignment into 1 million base pair (1 Mbp) segments and seeing how many of the bases within each 1 Mbp segment have no aligning base within the query genome that has been aligned to it. If the entire 1 Mbp segment has no alignment by the target genome, it has gap divergence of 100 percent. If 10,000 bp have no alignment, it has gap divergence of 1 percent; if 1,000 bp have no alignment, it has gap divergence of 0.1 percent, etc. According to the study's results, the mean gap divergence in each 1 Mbp segment of the human genome (as target) aligned to the chimp genome (as query) is 12.5 percent. Thus, 12.5 percent of bases in the human genome have no aligning base in the chimpanzee genome within the whole genome-alignment. The figure below - created for illustrative purposes and not from the study - helps show the differences between ""SNVs"" and ""Gaps"" between the two genomes: As you can see, the Gaps represent nucleotides or segments of nucleotides that simply don't exist in one genome or the other, while the SNVs represent nucleotides that do exist but are different. The two types of differences can be added up to calculate the total difference between the genomes. An Upper Estimate And why is there a range of 12.5 percent to 27.3 percent in the main text? That's because the upper estimate of the non-alignability between the gorilla genome and human genome is a whopping 27.3 percent. In fact, if we look at the Supplementary Figure III.12, we find the following percentages of ""gap-divergence"" between various ape genomes when compared to the human genome (non-sex chromosomes): Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) vs human: 15.4 percent and 16.5 percent ""gap-divergence"" (i.e., minimum difference) Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) vs human: 17.9 percent and 27.3 percent ""gap-divergence"" (i.e., minimum difference) Bonobo (Pan paniscus) vs human: 12.5 percent and 14.4 percent ""gap-divergence"" (i.e., minimum difference) Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) vs human: 12.5 percent and 13.3 percent ""gap-divergence"" (i.e., minimum difference) Do you see how easy it is to summarize that data? These are huge findings for both science and the wider culture, yet the technical Nature paper, and the two Nature explainer articles, failed to clearly bring out these points. They buried them in technical jargon and a lack of clarity deep in the Supplemental Data, and the sentence about ""The oft-quoted statistic of ~99% sequence identity"" was removed in the revisions of the paper. Nature, I feel confident in assuring you, is not a haphazardly edited journal. These were deliberate choices by someone during the editing process. The lack of clarity is simply incredible. The Technical Details Deep in the Supplementary Data we find Figure III.12 which explains the gap divergence between different species: The caption reads: ""Plots show 1 Mbp segments binned by gap divergence for each pairwise alignment,"" where a pairwise alignment is an attempt to align two sequences to determine their degree of similarity or difference. Thus, we're looking at a direct measure of the minimum degree of difference between the two genomes. Adding in the Single Nucleotide Variation (SNV) But there's another type of variation between genomes also identified in the paper - single nucleotide differences (called ""single nucleotide variations"" or sometimes ""short nucleotide variations"" or SNVs). Again, buried in the Supplemental Data we find Figure III.11 which shows the percentage of SNVs between human and various ape genomes reported in this study. Here's what they found: Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo abelii) vs Human: ~3.6 percent different Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) vs Human: 1.9 percent - 2.0 percent different Bonobo (Pan paniscus) vs Human: 1.5 percent - 1.6 percent different Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) vs Human: 1.5 percent - 1.6 percent different If we add the gap divergence to the SNV differences, we end up with these total degrees of difference between human and ape genomes: Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo abelii) vs Human: ~19 percent - 20.1 percent different Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) vs Human: ~19.8 percent - 29.3 percent different Bonobo (Pan paniscus) vs Human: ~14.0 percent - 16.0 percent different Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) (target) vs. Human: ~14.0 percent different Human (target) vs. Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes): ~14.9 percent different So now what we're seeing is that there is about a 14.9 percent total difference between the human genome and the chimp genome. That represents a much greater degree of difference than the often-claimed statistic that we are only 1 percent genetically different from chimpanzees! Is This the Final Word? Undoubtedly more analysis is needed to determine the extent to which nucleotides exhibit ""one-to-one exact matches"" between the human and chimp genomes, even in the regions that could be more easily aligned. So I suspect that the degree of difference between human and chimp genomes may go up in the future. For now, we can safely say that this latest study shows that the human and chimp genomes are at least 14.9 percent different. This means that the human and chimp genomes are at least a full order of magnitude more dissimilar than the public is typically told. Of course we're talking here about the 44 non-sex chromosomes in the human genome. It's also worth noting that compared to chimps, the human Y chromosome has a whopping 56.6 percent gap divergence (and 3.9 percent SNV divergence), and the human X chromosome has 4.4 percent gap divergence (and 1.1 percent SNV divergence). But that too is all buried in the Supplemental Data. These are all groundbreaking findings - and it's a shame that Nature would not report the data clearly and would make all of this so hard to find - using jargon that most non-experts won't understand. Why did they do this? It's important to realize that publishing scientific papers can be a bit like sausage-making: it's often messy, and the final form that you read usually represents compromise language that all of the authors, reviewers, and editors were willing to publish - and may not represent precisely how every author of a paper feels. So perhaps some authors of this study would have preferred to state the implications more plainly. But we can still ask, Why didn't Nature state the results clearly and let the chips fall where they may? I suspect that this radical finding has implications - not just for science, but also for human exceptionalism, for the reliability of heavily marketed talking points, and more - that people will be discussing for a long time. And perhaps for some in the worlds of science and science reporting, especially those who touted the now discredited figure about a mere 1 percent difference from chimps, those conversations may not be welcome."

Now that we've reached this milestone, it's fascinating to examine how accurate his technological and space-related forecasts turned out to be. Despite being confined to a wheelchair with ALS since age 21, Hawking's brilliant mind peered into the future with remarkable clarity. Space mining and private space exploration One of Hawking's most intriguing predictions concerned the commercialization of space. He foresaw private companies venturing beyond Earth's atmosphere to mine asteroids for rare metals. While we haven't quite reached full-scale asteroid mining operations in 2025, this vision is rapidly materializing. Several private companies are developing technologies to make asteroid mining commercially viable. This aligns with recent discoveries about space resources that continue to fascinate scientists. Just months ago, researchers identified the source of a mysterious cosmic phenomenon through seemingly trivial light flickers, demonstrating how even subtle observations can lead to major breakthroughs in understanding space resources. Hawking also predicted the growing problem of space debris from increased missions. This has indeed become a significant challenge as satellite deployments have multiplied. Space agencies now actively track thousands of debris pieces that threaten operational spacecraft. The commercialization of space exploration has unfolded exactly as Hawking envisioned. Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic have transformed space access, making what was once exclusively governmental now increasingly private. This shift has accelerated technological development while creating new economic opportunities in the space sector. Digital transformation and artificial intelligence Hawking accurately predicted the ubiquity of the internet and its profound impact on communication and information access. In 1995, when the world wide web was still in its infancy, he foresaw how digital connectivity would reshape society. His vision extended to artificial intelligence integration in everyday devices. Today, virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant have become household staples, confirming Hawking's foresight. These AI systems now manage everything from home automation to personal scheduling, just as he anticipated. The digital transformation Hawking described has fundamentally altered how we interact with our environment. This technological evolution connects to our growing understanding of the universe. Scientists recently announced that a new telescope might soon reveal the ninth planet in our solar system, showcasing how digital technologies enhance our cosmic exploration capabilities. Hawking's understanding of how AI would transform daily life proved remarkably accurate. From smart homes to recommendation algorithms, artificial intelligence has become so integrated into modern living that we often take its presence for granted-exactly the seamless adoption Hawking predicted thirty years ago. Robotics revolution across industries The integration of robotics into industry, medicine, and public service was another key prediction from Hawking. Today, robots perform complex tasks in factories, assist in delicate surgeries, and even serve customers in retail environments. In manufacturing, robots have revolutionized production lines, increasing efficiency while transforming traditional labor roles. This shift mirrors recent space exploration advancements where NASA's Mars exploration has revealed discoveries that reshape our understanding of the Red Planet. Both developments demonstrate humanity's technological ingenuity. Medical robotics has particularly flourished, with surgical robots enabling procedures previously considered impossible. Meanwhile, service robots have entered restaurants, hotels, and cleaning services-though perhaps not quite as extensively as Hawking might have imagined. The relationship between space exploration and robotics continues to develop synergistically. Recent research indicating that a meteorite found in Morocco provided direct evidence of thermal water on Mars highlights how robotics will play a crucial role in future planetary exploration. Predictions still awaiting fulfillment While many of Hawking's forecasts materialized, some remain unfulfilled. His vision of ultra-rapid travel hasn't quite arrived, and subcutaneous banking chips haven't become mainstream despite advances in wearable payment technologies. The physicist also didn't anticipate some developments, like the recent concerns about Asteroid 2024 YR4's potential collision with Earth, which demonstrates that even brilliant minds can't predict everything about our cosmic future. Hawking's most aspirational predictions may still materialize in coming decades. Recent lunar observations where scientists discovered how two massive moon canyons formed billions of years ago remind us that significant discoveries often arrive on their own timeline rather than our predicted schedules. Stephen Hawking passed away in 2018 at age 76, but his legacy extends beyond his scientific contributions to include these remarkable predictions that helped shape our expectations for technological progress. His visionary thinking continues to inspire scientists and innovators striving to turn more of his predictions into reality."
Scientists Studying Life Forms at the Base of a Glacier in Antarctica Make a Shocking Discovery - The Debrief,science,Scientists studying extreme life forms living at the base of a glacier in Antarctica made a shocking discovery.,Christopher Plain,Thedebrief.org,2025-05-21T12:58:02+00:00,A team of scientists studying the biodiversity of microscopic organisms living at the base of a slowly retreating glacier on the southern coast of Antarctica has made an intriguing discovery: separate life forms are working in collaboration to survive and thrive in one of the planet's most extreme e...,"['organisms', 'species', 'living', 'antarctica', 'life']",https://thedebrief.org/scientists-studying-life-forms-at-the-base-of-a-glacier-in-antarctica-make-a-shocking-discovery/,"A team of scientists studying the biodiversity of microscopic organisms living at the base of a slowly retreating glacier on the southern coast of Antarctica has made an intriguing discovery: separate life forms are working in collaboration to survive and thrive in one of the planet's most extreme environments. The researchers believe their findings could force a significant recalculation of previous Antarctic soil biodiversity estimates and provide unique insights into the mechanisms seemingly incompatible life forms employ to create and support a viable local habitat collectively. ""Here we reveal unexpectedly abundant and diverse microbial community even in these driest, coldest, and nutrient-poorest of soils, which suggest that biodiversity estimates in Antarctic soils may be greatly underestimated,"" said corresponding author, Dr Dirk Wagner, a professor at the GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences and the University of Potsdam in Germany. ""Furthermore, it provides important initial insights into the range of interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes in these harsh environments."" Discovery IN Antarctica Adds to the Continent's ""Life"" Story Antarctica was once considered a frozen and (mostly) lifeless desert that barely supported the scant few organisms capable of braving its intense cold and limited sunlight. More recently, scientists working in Antarctica have made several discoveries rewriting the story of life on the planet's southernmost continent. While several study efforts are investigating Antarctica's non-biological mysteries, including the disappearance of unusual formations on the continent's surface and a Soviet-era underwater mystery dating back millions of years, understanding how disparate life forms endure this environment is critical to understanding our planet's history and informs the search for life in the cosmos. In 2021, scientists discovered ""extremophiles"" living beneath the Antarctic Ice Shelf. New Zealand scientists made a similar discovery when they found an entire community of organisms living and thriving beneath the Antarctic ice. Earlier this year, scientists found an equally diverse ecosystem of organisms living beneath the 14 meters of ice covering Antarctica's Lake Enigma. In March, an iceberg the size of Chicago suddenly broke off, revealing a thriving community of organisms living underneath. Hoping to build on those efforts by improving estimates of biodiversity in one of the harshest places on the continent, the place where a glacier has disturbed the soil, some members of the research team hitched a ride aboard the ANT-XXIII/9' expedition of the German research vessel Polarstern' to Antarctica. After taking a helicopter to the front of a slowly retreating glacier in the Larsemann Hills on the southern shore of Prydz Bay, the research team began collecting soil samples. Based on their findings published in Frontiers in Microbiology, the trip wasn't wasted. Samples Reveal Unexpected Species Diversity According to a statement announcing the discovery, the team collected samples at five distances from the glacier, ranging between zero and 80 meters. Three distinct samples were collected at each distance, ranging between zero and 30 centimeters. Using a process called high-throughput DNA barcoding,' the team measured each sample's bacterial and eukaryotic biodiversity. The study authors say evaluating this type of DNA is critical to distinguishing whether the samples contain dead or living organisms, particularly when examining species diversity. ""By distinguishing between intracellular iDNA from living organisms and extracellular eDNA from dead organisms, we could reveal colonizers and locally extinct species preserved in soils,"" said Wagner. ""This allowed us to understand the relationships between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms and gain insights into their interactions over time. After counting all the identifiable organisms, the team's haul netted 2,829 genetically defined species. As expected, the diversity of iDNA was most concentrated in the top layer, with a bacterial ""species richness"" 10.3 times greater than eukaryotes. The researchers also noted that each distance from the glacier had its own ""unique range of species."" Notably, 40% of the identified species were found using eDNA, meaning they were dead. Teamwork Makes the (Microscopic) Dream Work A closer examination of the different life forms living at the base of this Antarctic glacier found several indications that these disparate species were working together to survive. For example, cryophilic' (cold-loving) fungi found closer to the glacier, where the soil is most disturbed, may contribute to the first phase of soil formation. Soil formation is critical for building habitats that other microscopic organisms occupy in these microenvironments. ""We detected previously unrecognized associations between bacteria and eukaryotes, for example between certain green algae and bacteria, which may promote nutrient exchange,"" Wagner explained. ""We also found consistent co-occurrence of certain fungi and actinobacteria, which suggests that these fungi could provide carbon for the bacteria by degrading organic matter."" Taken as a whole, the team's discovery offers previously unavailable insights into the overall species diversity living in a part of the world once considered mostly uninhabitable. Wagner also believes their findings suggest ""novel mutualisms"" between a ""tightly linked consortia of species that optimize the utilization of resources,"" which enable them to survive collectively in an environment they may not survive in individually. ""By focusing on both current and past lineages of microbes, our study shows how colonization and environmental alteration through ecological succession helped change the extreme habitat of Antarctica's Larsemann Hills, making them gradually more hospitable to the current considerable diversity of life,"" he concluded."
New research findings challenge Einstein’s landmark theory of relativity - The Brighter Side of News,science,The discovery in 1998 that the Universe’s expansion is speeding up has become one of the deepest and most enduring puzzles in modern physics.,Joshua Shavit,Thebrighterside.news,2025-05-21T11:51:00+00:00,"While the CDM model has been a cornerstone of cosmology, it is showing its limitations as researchers seek to explain observations beyond its scope.

(CREDIT: ESO/L. Calcada/spaceengine.org) The discovery in 1998 that the Universe is expanding faster over time shook the foundations of cosmology. This finding challenged deep-seated assumptions about how space behaves on the grandest scales. To explain this cosmic acceleration, scientists have developed a variety of ideas. Some turn to the cosmological constant-a constant energy density filling all of space. Others explore dark energy as something more dynamic. Still, others question whether Einstein's theory of general relativity needs a rewrite. Testing these ideas requires vast sky surveys that chart the positions of galaxies and the structure of matter. New Insights into Cosmic Expansion The standard CDM model has long guided our understanding of the Universe. But its limits are becoming more apparent as new data rolls in. Researchers are now exploring paths beyond CDM to better match observations. Einstein's equations by introducing two functions,  and , which describe changes in gravity and metric distortions. (CREDIT: Nicolle Fuller/National Science Foundation) One approach involves broad theoretical models like Horndeski theories. These incorporate scalar-tensor interactions and second-order equations. Their strength lies in connecting what we see in space to deep physical laws. Yet, their complexity comes with a cost. The models produce overlapping effects-called degeneracies-that make it hard to pinpoint exact causes from the data alone. A second method takes a more practical route. It tweaks Einstein's equations using two key parameters:  (mu) and  (eta). These describe how gravity might deviate from predictions and how space and time may stretch differently. The  parameter adjusts Poisson's equation, which governs how mass creates gravitational fields. It affects how strongly gravity pulls at large scales. The  parameter measures how space and time distort differently. This helps scientists explore whether gravity behaves differently across cosmic distances. Together,  and  offer a flexible way to test how gravity operates. These parameters play a central role in interpreting data from major projects. For instance, gravitational lensing results from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) depend on them. So do galaxy clustering maps from surveys like BOSS and eBOSS. These tools let scientists probe the unseen forces shaping the cosmos. Despite their promise, these methods bring hurdles. The values of  and  are tied to redshift, or how far back in time we're looking. This demands either fixed models of how they evolve or complex reconstructions. On top of that, the models assume Euler's equation holds for dark matter-an assumption that may not always fit. These issues introduce new layers of complexity in understanding the data. Redefining the Limits of Einstein's Theory Einstein's general relativity revolutionized our understanding of gravity, depicting the Universe as a flexible fabric deformed by massive objects. This theory, confirmed by the 1919 solar eclipse, predicted the deflection of light by gravity, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. By studying how light bends around celestial bodies, scientists gain critical insights into the Universe's structure and expansion.

Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi) But are Einstein's equations valid on the largest cosmic scales? Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier have sought to answer this question. Using DES data, they analyzed the distortion of time and space, comparing their findings to Einstein's predictions. Camille Bonvin, an associate professor at UNIGE, highlights the novelty of this approach: ""Until now, Dark Energy Survey data have been used to measure the distribution of matter in the Universe. In our study, we used this data to directly measure the distortion of time and space, enabling us to compare our findings with Einstein's predictions."" A Universe Slightly Out of Sync The DES provided data on 100 million galaxies across four time periods: 3.5, 5, 6, and 7 billion years ago. These measurements revealed how gravitational wells-regions where gravity deforms space-time-evolved. Measured values of \(\hat{J}\) with 1 standard deviation error bars at the mean redshifts of the MAGLIM sample. (CREDIT: Nature Communications) According to Isaac Tutusaus, lead author of the study, ""We discovered that in the distant past - 6 and 7 billion years ago - the depth of the wells aligns well with Einstein's predictions. However, closer to today, 3.5 and 5 billion years ago, they are slightly shallower than predicted by Einstein."" This discrepancy coincides with the period when the Universe's expansion began accelerating. The data hint at a possible link between the two phenomena, suggesting that gravity might operate differently on cosmic scales. Tutusaus notes, ""The slower growth of gravitational wells and the accelerating expansion might share the same underlying cause."" The 3-Sigma Challenge The study found a 3-sigma level of incompatibility between Einstein's predictions and the observed data. While this is significant, it falls short of the 5-sigma threshold needed to definitively challenge the theory. Nastassia Grimm, a co-author and postdoctoral researcher at UNIGE, explains, ""Such an incompatibility threshold arouses our interest and calls for further investigations. But this incompatibility is not large enough, at this stage, to invalidate Einstein's theory."" Predictions for \(\hat{J}\) for modified gravity models with  = 1 and  = 1. (CREDIT: Nature Communications) Further research is necessary to confirm these findings. The team is turning to the Euclid space telescope, launched last year, which promises more precise gravitational lensing data. Over its six-year mission, Euclid will observe 1.5 billion galaxies, offering unprecedented insights into the Universe's history and allowing scientists to test Einstein's equations more rigorously. As cosmologists delve deeper into the mysteries of the Universe, the boundaries of established theories are being pushed. The work of the UNIGE and Toulouse teams represents a critical step in this journey. With upcoming data from Euclid, the scientific community is poised to refine its understanding of gravity and cosmic expansion. These efforts may ultimately reshape our perception of the Universe, bringing us closer to solving one of science's greatest enigmas. Note: Materials provided above by The Brighter Side of News.

Dating back to around 355 BC, this manuscript predates previously known structured star catalogs by centuries. It reflects a sophisticated astronomical tradition that connected celestial observations with imperial governance, a system maintained by Chinese bureaucrats for nearly two millennia. Celestial Symbolism Rooted in Imperial Culture The catalog features constellations depicting an imperial court in the sky, including an emperor's chariot, a celestial marketplace, and even a star representing a toilet with excrement. These images highlight how early Chinese astronomers, possibly including Shi Shen-an influential astrologer from the Warring States period-organized the night sky into symbolic forms reflecting earthly structures. The system linked heavenly omens to the emperor's mandate, allowing court astrologers to interpret cosmic events as guidance for maintaining harmony on Earth. The catalog survived through multiple centuries via careful copying and preservation. Around the third century AD, an astronomer recopied Shi's data or work inspired by his school, which was further preserved during the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD). Some manuscripts were discovered centuries later, including one reportedly found in the belly of a Buddha statue roughly 400 years ago. New Computational Methods Reveal Dating and Updates Astronomers Boliang He and Yongheng Zhao from NAO used a computational algorithm based on the Generalized Hough Transform, an image-processing technique, to analyze historical star catalogs. Their algorithm processes ancient star coordinates, filters out corrupted or erroneous data, and estimates the celestial North Pole's historical position to date the catalog accurately. Their analysis suggests that about half of the star positions in the Star Manual of Master Shi date back to approximately 355 BC, corresponding to the era of Shi Shen. The other half appear to have been updated around 125 AD likely during the Eastern Han dynasty, when astronomers, including the famous Zhang Heng-an inventor of the armillary sphere and twice Grand Astrologer (Taishi Ling)-systematically incorporated new observations. This layered composition explains inconsistencies in star positions noted in previous studies. A seventh century star chart found in Dunhuang, China, includes this map of the celestial north pole based on a synthesis of ancient Chinese astronomical schools of thought. The map's faded, reddish stars belong to a star catalog created by the legendary Chinese astronomer Shi Shen: a record that a new study now claims is the oldest surviving star catalog found anywhere in the word. British Library archive/Bridgeman Images Scholarly Debate on Accuracy and Dating Despite this breakthrough, the catalog's dating remains debated. Historian Boshun Yang argues that many of the older star positions could result from measurements taken with a misaligned instrument, possibly off by about one degree from the true celestial north pole. Such misalignment would skew the perceived precession, creating two distinct clusters of dates in the catalog's star positions. Yang and others suggest the catalog's spherical coordinate system aligns better with a first-century BC origin, when the armillary sphere was invented and a spherical cosmological model adopted in China. This model replaced earlier conceptions of a flat universe, marking a significant shift in Chinese astronomy. Daniel Patrick Morgan, historian at France's Center for Research on East Asian Civilizations, compares the idea of a 4th-century BC spherical coordinate system to ""finding a gas station receipt from 1700,"" emphasizing the challenge this early dating poses to conventional historical understanding.

Credit: British Museum, CC BY-SA 4.0 Placing the Catalog in Global Astronomical History If confirmed, the Star Manual of Master Shi would be older than the Greek Hipparchus catalog from about 130 BC , which has long been considered the earliest structured star catalog in Western astronomy. While Babylonian star records date back to the 8th century BC and note when stars rise, these do not feature the detailed graphical layouts and coordinate systems seen in the Chinese catalog. The catalog's survival and updates over centuries reflect a continuous tradition of Chinese astronomy that influenced scientific development far beyond its origins. Researchers He and Zhao plan to apply their methods to other traditional Chinese star catalogs and explore later periods, including the Ming dynasty era when Chinese and Western astronomy first interacted. Their work aligns with broader cultural aims to highlight China's scientific heritage and promote cross-cultural exchange, echoing Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for ""civilizations [to] thrive through mutual exchange and learning."" This study is currently under review by the journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics and adds a new chapter to the understanding of humanity's oldest astronomical records."

Showing a halo of light surrounding an eclipsed sun with the Moon passing through, it was taken during PUNCH's commissioning stage-a step to ensure all the equipment is in alignment and functioning properly. The Moon in the image is lit up by light reflected off the surface of Earth. Launched on March 11th, the four-satellite constellation was designed to study to solar wind by using a science instrument called an occulter. With extreme precision, an occulter places a disk over the Sun before photographing it. The large golden aura is formed from the incoming light reflected off the sun-side of the occulter, while a shred of light can be seen around the Sun's corona, or crown. This is the Sun's outermost atmosphere, and the easiest place the study the solar wind. Solar wind amounts to about 300,000 tons (272,000 metric tons) of material which the Sun ejects into the solar system every second. Made up of charged particles, they are responsible for the Northern lights down on Earth, and also a variable amount of disruption to Earthborn electronics. It's believed that streamers and plasma loops bursting out of the Sun which PUNCH will photograph can be tracked and used to estimate and forecast space weather like the solar wind, perhaps allowing countries to better prepare for incoming magnetic storms which could disrupt communications or even cause sudden blackouts. Complementing PUNCH's mission will be the more famous craft called the Parker Solar Probe, which in 2021 became the first manmade object to enter the Sun's atmosphere and exit it intact. Whilst doing so, it took some pretty epic photos itself, and the imaging potential of the two crafts will allow scientists to study our star in much greater detail.

The aim of this work was to investigate the behavior of microorganisms, gathered from a completely sealed environment with a human crew, during space travel, as part of the China Space Station Habitation Area Microbiome Program (CHAMP). A paper published in the Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology describes how analysis of samples from the space station revealed this previously unseen bacterial species, which belongs to the genus Niallia. Genomic sequencing showed that its closest terrestrial relative is the bacterium Niallia circulans, although the Tiangong species has substantial genetic differences. Niallia tiangongensis exhibits structural and functional variations that mean it is well-adapted to existing in a space station. It possesses the ability to hydrolyze gelatin (break down this protein into smaller components) in a unique way, allowing the protein to be consumed for survival in nutrient-poor environments. In addition, these bacteria are able to form a protective biofilm, activate oxidative stress responses, and promote repair in the face of radiation damage. ""This aids their survival in the space environment,"" the paper explains. Bacteria of the genus Niallia are characterized by their rod-like shape, a thick cell wall, absence of an outer membrane, and their ability to form endospores that ensure their survival in adverse conditions. Niallia circulans, for example, encapsulates its genetic material in a highly protected cell, which remains inactive until the environment becomes favorable again. It is unclear whether the newly discovered microbe evolved on the space station or whether it is part of the vast sea of as yet unidentified microorganisms on Earth. To date, tens of thousands of bacterial species have been cataloged, although there are estimated to be billions more unclassified species on Earth. The discovery of Niallia tiangongensis will provide a better understanding of the microscopic hazards that the next generation of space travelers will face and help design sanitation protocols for extended missions. It is still too early to determine whether the space bacterium poses any danger to taikonauts aboard Tiangong, although it is known that its terrestrial relative, Niallia circulans, can cause sepsis, especially in immunocompromised people.

This massive rift stretches approximately 2,000 kilometers (about 1,900 miles) in a horseshoe shape, running from Kansas north to Lake Superior and then curving south again to Michigan. The rifting process threatened to split the North American continent in two but stopped suddenly after about 100,000 years, leaving behind a mysterious scar buried mostly under sediment. A Billion-Year-Old Crack Filled With Basalt and Magma The Midcontinent Rift formed as tectonic forces pulled the Earth's crust apart in two opposing directions, opening a massive fissure beneath the continent. Magma rose from deep within the Earth, filling the rift and cooling into a thick belt of basalt, a dark, fine-grained volcanic rock formed by rapidly solidified lava. These basalt outcrops are still visible today, especially near Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula in northern Michigan. This region lent its name to the rift, often called the Keweenaw Rift. The rift basin was once as wide as the modern Red Sea. The Rift's Abrupt Halt and Its ""Spectacular Failure"" Despite the rift's massive size and potential to split the continent and create a new ocean, the process stopped after roughly 100,000 years. The cause of this sudden stop remains uncertain and is a topic of ongoing scientific debate. According to Live Science, G. Randy Keller, professor emeritus of geophysics at the University of Oklahoma and director of the Oklahoma Geological Survey, described it as a ""spectacular failure."" He said, ""It's incredible that something of this scale could remodel the crust of the Earth in the Lake Superior region and not manage to break the continent apart."" Some scientists suggest the halt in rifting may be linked to a mountain-building episode along North America's Atlantic coast. Others reject this and propose the rifting ended when a sea opened between Laurentia and Amazonia-the ancient geologic cores of North and South America. This debate has continued for more than a decade without definitive answers. A map of the Midcontinent Rift, which opened 1.1 billion years ago. (Image credit: U.S. Geological Survey) Buried Beneath Sediment, Revealed by Glaciers After rifting stopped, thick layers of sediment began to accumulate in the valley, pushing the structure deeper into the Earth's crust. A subsequent period of compression caused volcanic and sedimentary rocks to be pushed upward, exposing some parts of the rift. Over the last 2.5 million years, cycles of glacier growth and melting eroded away some of the sediment layers, revealing exposed sections of the rift valley. The most visible outcrops are found near Lake Superior, especially on Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula, where ancient basalt and copper-rich rocks appear. Humans have mined copper from this region for at least 8,000 years. Mining continued through the late 20th century and has recently seen renewed interest. The National Park Service describes these rocks as ""unique, born of an exceptional geological event."" The present landscape was mostly shaped by the past 2.5 million years, with repeated glaciations scouring the landscape. Credit: The National Park Service Modern Exploration and Significance Parts of the Midcontinent Rift, particularly in Kansas, have attracted resource exploration companies. Basalt rock can chemically react with water to generate hydrogen, which is seen as a potential clean energy source and a vital ingredient in several chemical processes. This highlights the ongoing practical interest in the rift beyond its geological importance. The Midcontinent Rift remains a rare example of a giant tectonic event that reshaped a large region but stopped short of splitting the continent. It stretches roughly 3,000 kilometers (1,900 miles) and created a basin as wide as the Red Sea. Its exposed volcanic rocks near Lake Superior and copper deposits mark this billion-year-old scar in North America's crust, revealing the continent's dynamic and complex geological past."

The European Space Agency's Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) has detected an enormous water reservoir beneath the Martian surface, comparable in size to Earth's Red Sea. This remarkable finding opens new possibilities for future Mars missions and enhances our knowledge of the planet's hydrological history. Massive water deposit discovered beneath Martian equator Scientists have identified an extensive ice-rich deposit hidden beneath the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF), a geological structure near Mars' equator. This water reservoir extends to depths of 2.7 kilometers-significantly deeper than previous scientific estimates. If melted, this ice deposit could potentially flood the entire Martian surface with approximately 2.7 meters of water. ""We revisited the MFF using recent data from Mars Express' MARSIS radar and discovered the deposits were even thicker than we originally thought,"" explained Thomas Watters, lead author of the study and researcher at the Smithsonian Institution. The discovery's significance cannot be overstated, as it provides critical insights into Mars' capacity to potentially support future human missions. The MFF has long puzzled researchers, spanning hundreds of kilometers and reaching heights exceeding 1.6 kilometers in some areas. Located at the equatorial region, this formation marks the boundary between Mars' northern lowlands and southern highlands. The substantial water reservoir beneath this formation represents one of the most significant discoveries that reshapes our understanding of Mars in recent decades. Implications for Mars' climate history and future exploration The confirmation of ice within the MFF comes after radar scans revealed a structure with unusual density that remains transparent to radar signals. Scientists now face the challenge of determining when these ice deposits formed and what environmental conditions existed on Mars during that period. Colin Wilson, Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter project scientist at ESA, posed the critical question: ""When did these ice deposits form, and what was Mars like during that time?"" This question becomes increasingly relevant as we continue developing technologies to potentially visit the Red Planet, similar to how NASA monitors near-Earth objects for planetary defense. The presence of water resources on Mars represents strategic value for future missions. Astronauts could potentially use Martian water for drinking, oxygen production, and even fuel generation-significantly reducing dependency on Earth-supplied materials. While new telescopes reveal distant celestial bodies in our solar system, this discovery brings our attention closer to our planetary neighbor. Technical challenges and scientific opportunities The MFF's surface presents significant landing difficulties for space missions. A thick layer of dust or ash covers the ice deposit, creating a complex terrain for spacecraft. However, this dusty covering itself presents unique research opportunities. Scientists believe these dust-rich deposits, sculpted by wind into striking ridges, have influenced Mars' atmosphere for millions of years. Similar to how Earth's atmospheric changes are carefully monitored, understanding Mars' climate history provides crucial comparative data. This discovery confirms previous theories about Mars' water history, complementing evidence from Martian meteorites found on Earth that indicated past water presence. ""Each discovery of Martian ice enriches our understanding of the planet's hydrological history and current water distribution,"" stated Wilson. Just as lunar observations reveal surprising geological features, Mars continues to yield unexpected discoveries that reshape planetary science. The future of Mars exploration This water reservoir discovery will likely influence future Mars mission planning and research priorities. Scientists must now determine the exact composition of these ice deposits and develop strategies to potentially access them despite challenging surface conditions. The find provides important clues about cosmic phenomena and planetary formation. The presence of such extensive water resources significantly improves prospects for eventual human settlement on Mars. Throughout human history, water access has determined settlement patterns, and Mars exploration follows this same principle. Just as preserved ancient specimens on Earth provide historical insights, Mars' water deposits offer a window into the planet's past. As technology advances and more missions target the Red Planet, our understanding of Mars' hydrological systems will continue to expand, potentially revealing additional water reservoirs and further transforming our perception of our planetary neighbor."

These moments of insight are super-satisfying, but it turns out they can also reveal really important things about how our brains hold onto memories, as a new study from scientists in the US and Germany has uncovered. There's a reason why the story of Archimedes, the ancient Greek master mathematician and bath enthusiast, resonates with so many people. The possibly apocryphal tale of the great thinker running naked through the streets yelling ""Eureka!"" is, if not exactly relatable, at least understandable. It feels really great to solve a puzzle that's been bugging you, especially when it comes with a satisfying flash of insight - an ""aha!"" moment. ""I've always found those sudden moments of insight - those Aha!' experiences - deeply fascinating,"" study first author Maxi Becker, a postdoctoral fellow at Humboldt University in Berlin, told IFLScience. ""They're powerful emotionally, giving you a rush of pleasure, and they're also striking cognitively, because once the answer clicks into place, it suddenly feels obvious and perfectly fitting with what you already know."" ""Since my PhD, I've been curious about how the brain produces these moments - what's going on under the hood, so to speak."" I wasn't expecting the patterns to emerge as clearly and reliably as they did. Maxi Becker Teaming up with co-author Tobias Sommer and senior author Roberto Cabeza, Becker conducted a study with 31 volunteers aged between 19 and 33. The participants were asked to solve visual puzzles while lying in an MRI scanner, and functional MRI data was collected to try to capture the moment the answers came to them. ""With these methods, we can now actually observe how brain activity shifts as a person moves from confusion to clarity - from searching for meaning to that sudden moment when everything makes sense,"" Becker explained. Ssssseee what it isssss yet? Image credit: Courtesy of Maxi Becker The idea behind the puzzles, called Mooney images, is simple. You look at a black and white, high-contrast photo and try to figure out what real-world object it is depicting. Whether you figure out the answer at a snail's pace or in a sudden rush of insight has quite an impact on your memory, it turns out. Image credit: Courtesy of Maxi Becker ""It's just a little discovery that you are making, but it produces the same type of characteristics that exist in more important insight events,"" said Cabeza in a statement. Each time, the participants were asked whether the solution had suddenly come to them, or whether they had figured out the answer more methodically. Later, some of the images they had already seen were shown to the participants again as a memory recall exercise. ""I was genuinely surprised by how consistent the results turned out to be,"" Becker told IFLScience. ""Neuroimaging tends to be quite noisy, especially when examining something as complex and abstract as insight. So I wasn't expecting the patterns to emerge as clearly and reliably as they did."" What the team saw was that solutions that came with an ""aha!"" moment were remembered much better by participants than those they had worked out more deliberately. The more strongly someone felt that their flash of inspiration was correct, the more likely they'd be to remember it five days later. Cabeza commented, ""If you have an aha! moment' while learning something, it almost doubles your memory. There are few memory effects that are as powerful as this."" ""The effect of insight on memory is striking and has meaningful implications for how we understand and support human learning,"" Becker told us, explaining that this research could have applications in teaching and education. ""This points to the value of learning experiences that promote insight - such as encouraging students to generate solutions, grapple with ambiguity, or engage in ways that spark aha' moments. Such approaches may not only improve retention but also foster deeper, more conceptual understanding."" ""While further research is needed to explore how broadly this applies, especially beyond visual problems, our results highlight the potential of insight-driven learning as a powerful tool for education."" The study is published in the journal Nature Communications."

This stunning breakthrough won the top award at the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's Science Photography Competition in the UK. But how has this groundbreaking image impacted science? What are Atoms? Atoms are made up of a nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around this nucleus. To clarify, protons carry a positive charge, electrons are negatively charged, and neutrons have no charge at all. Atoms are categorized by their number of protons, which determines their chemical element. There are over a hundred different chemical elements, ranging from hydrogen, the simplest, to oganesson, the most complex. These elements can combine to form molecules. In essence, atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter. They make up everything we see, from the air we breathe to the largest galaxies in the universe. Thus, their study is crucial. However, studying atoms is particularly challenging because they are incredibly small, measuring only a few tenths of a nanometer in diameter (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter). Physicists manipulate atoms using electromagnetic fields. For a long time, however, researchers could only study atoms in groups, which makes the photograph of a single strontium atom taken by physicist David Nadlinger from the University of Oxford even more remarkable. A Significant Technical Feat To capture this image, the atom was first cooled to an extremely low temperature using a laser, then trapped in place by magnetic fields. A special camera designed for capturing single ions was then used to illuminate the atom with an ion beam, making it visible. In the image, it appears as a tiny, bright blue dot suspended in the void between two electrodes. It's important to note that the original photo was taken in black and white and was later colorized to enhance the visibility of the strontium atom. Moreover, the image does not directly show the atom's nucleus. Instead, the electrons, which move rapidly around the nucleus, are the only parts that can interact with light to create a visible image. Thus, it is the electron cloud around the nucleus that is visible, not the nucleus itself. Why Choose Strontium? The physicist chose strontium for several reasons. Firstly, it's a relatively common element in nature, making it a practical choice for quantum physics experiments. Additionally, strontium is particularly suitable for cooling experiments, which are essential to trap a single atom. Cooling slows down the atom's movement, allowing it to be held in place. Finally, strontium is fascinating for quantum physics research because it has multiple isotopes, meaning different forms of the element have different numbers of neutrons. This allows physicists to conduct comparative experiments to explore the quantum properties of each isotope. What Impact Has This Had on Science? After its publication, this photograph won the EPSRC's scientific photography competition. This recognition was well-deserved as physicists have long sought ways to manipulate individual atoms to study them and use them in applications such as quantum computing (a type of computing based on the principles of quantum mechanics that can perform calculations much faster than current traditional computers). This photograph thus proved that such manipulations are now possible. The photo was also praised for its incredible ability to capture the beauty of science and to ""put a face"" on quantum physics. Since then, it has gained worldwide fame and has sparked enthusiasm for this particularly strange and complex field of study. Since its release, significant advancements have been made in the manipulation and control of individual atoms through increasingly precise experiments. Conclusion The photograph of this single strontium atom by David Nadlinger represents a significant advancement in the field of quantum physics. This technical achievement has demonstrated scientists' ability to manipulate and observe individual atoms, opening new avenues for more precise research. By facilitating a better understanding of quantum properties, this breakthrough has significant implications for the development of innovative technologies, such as quantum computing. This image is not only a testament to scientific ingenuity but also embodies the beauty of science and its ability to make the invisible tangible. The EPSRC's recognition of this photo highlighted the importance of fundamental research and its potential to transform our understanding of reality. By capturing the public's and scientists' imagination worldwide, this photo has bolstered interest and enthusiasm for exploring quantum mysteries. Through such breakthroughs, we continue to push the boundaries of our understanding, paving the way for future innovations that could revolutionize our world."

In an exciting advance for cancer treatment, scientists have developed a new type of powerful antibody that could help the immune system fight cancer more effectively. Researchers at the University of Southampton have redesigned antibodies, tiny proteins produced by white blood cells to defend against harmful invaders like bacteria and viruses. By tweaking the shape and stiffness of these proteins, the team discovered they could make them more effective at rallying the immune system against cancer cells. Their newly engineered antibody, which is more rigid than natural ones, triggered a significantly stronger immune response in early tests. Their findings, which were funded by Cancer Research UK, have been published in the journal Nature Communications. Key Insights From the Study Professor Mark Cragg, from the Centre for Cancer Immunology at the University of Southampton, said: ""The concept of using immuno-stimulation for cancer treatment is very exciting. ""Our study confirms that making even subtle increases in the rigidity of antibodies significantly stimulates immune activity, creating a powerful immune response against the disease. This approach works for multiple antibodies targeting different immune receptors. The ability to engineer these rigid antibodies could help develop more potent drugs that can stimulate the immune system to target cancer or other diseases."" The Y-shaped antibodies fight infections by targeting and then binding onto molecules on the surface of bacteria and viruses, or even cancerous cells. They can also be engineered to attach to receptors on immune cells to activate our body's immune defences. But not all antibodies do this effectively, said study co-author Isabel Elliott, a PhD student from Southampton. She added: ""The shape and flexibility of antibodies is crucial for how well they can activate immune cells - and we found more rigid antibodies seem to be better at this. The reason for this is likely because these rigid antibodies can hold molecules on the immune cells closer together, which triggers a stronger activation signal. Floppier antibodies are less likely to do this effectively."" Engineering the Antibody Structure The two arms of antibodies, which give its Y shape, are linked by a series of bridges, named disulfide bonds. The Southampton scientists managed to add extra bridges between the microscopic arms of the antibodies and tested it against standard variants. Dr Ivo Tews, a Professor in Structural Biology at Southampton, added: ""We used a supercomputer to visualise the structure of the antibody in atomic detail, allowing us to position extra disulfide bonds in the modified antibody. ""The results showed that the experiment worked and that the new, more rigid antibodies were more effective at activating immune cells. This idea of controlling antibody activity by making them more rigid seems to apply to many other similar molecules on immune cells."" Executive Director of Research and Innovation at Cancer Research UK, Dr Iain Foulkes, said: ""Refining our understanding of how to enable our immune systems to fight cancer is a complex but fundamental step in helping cancer patients to have the best chance of a good outcome when receiving immunotherapy treatment. Using the latest technologies to engineer this type of super-strong antibody that could trigger a promising immune response will empower us to continue pioneering new ways to outsmart cancer.""

Scientists worked hard to figure out what they were. Some proposed that they were seasonal streaks of briny ice, melting as the weak Mars summer arrived. New research says no to that. Our understanding of Mars, its past, and its ancient habitability hinges on our understanding of its water. The planet is cold and dry now, but was warm and wet in its past. One of the critical questions concerns what happened to its oceans' worth of water. When scientists started finding dark streaks on the Martian surface that looked like they could be seasonal water flows, it generated quite a bit of excitement. Could this be the remnants of Mars' ancient water, seeping onto the surface from where it's sequestered underground? Could this underground reservoir provide habitat for simple life? The streaks were named recurring slope lineae (RSL). They appear and reappear in the same places and can extend for hundreds of meters down slopes. New research in Nature Communications examined the issue and concluded that RSL and other streaks are not water-related. It's titled ""Streaks on martian slopes are dry,"" and the authors are Valentin Bickel and Adomas Valantinas. Bickel is from the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern in Switzerland, and Valantinas is from the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University. The research is focused on two related phenomena: RSL, which appear and disappear seasonally, and slope streaks, which can take years to fade. ""Slope streaks are dark albedo features on Martian slopes that form spontaneously and fade over years to decades,"" the researchers write. ""Along with seasonally recurring slope lineae, streak formation has been attributed to aqueous processes, implying the presence of transient yet substantial amounts of liquid water or brines on Mars' surface, with important implications for present-day Mars' habitability."" Previous research has identified many potential explanations for streaks and RSL. Ground springs of briny water, seasonal melt of briny ice, impact Marsquakes, and wind have all been proposed. Researchers have found that while RSL occur predominantly in the southern summer, streak formation is enhanced in the northern autumn and winter. ""To date, it remains unclear whether slope streaks and RSL are different expressions of the same process, or fundamentally different features,"" the authors write. Understanding these features correctly has consequences. If they have a wet formation mechanism, the planet has a more pronounced hydrological cycle than previously thought. That would affect our understanding of Mars' climate, weather, surface evolution, and potential habitability. We'll also have to be much more cautious about exploring Mars. ""In addition, liquid water or brines on Mars' surface would evoke serious concerns about planetary protection,"" the authors point out. To understand these streaks, the researchers created a catalogue of 500,000 of them. They found a total of 13,026 bright and 484,019 dark slope streaks. They display various morphologies and are both 'light' and 'dark' streaks. There's no absolutely clear delineation between bright and dark, but dark streaks are younger and appeared more recently, while light streaks are older. ""Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors,"" Bickel said. ""Then we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form."" After examining the data, the researchers reached some conclusions. ""Our observations discard three previously proposed dry streak formation mechanisms: dust devils, rockfalls, and thermal cycling do not appear to play a globally important role in triggering slope streaks,"" they write. They also found that their observations didn't support any wet-formation scenarios either. Streaks don't favour any particular slope orientation, challenging the idea that CO 2 frost is a trigger. However, dry formation scenarios are supported. ""We identify three global-scale, statistically significant relations that support dry formation hypotheses for slope streaks,"" the authors write. Streak populations are located slightly closer to new impacts, experience above-average surface wind velocities, and also experience above-average dust deposition rates in the northern winter, which coincides with their enhanced seasonal formation. ""A big focus of Mars research is understanding modern-day processes on Mars - including the possibility of liquid water on the surface,"" said lead author Valantinas in a press release. ""Our study reviewed these features but found no evidence of water. Our model favors dry formation processes."" frameborder=""0 allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" allowfullscreen> ""Our findings suggest that martian slopes currently do not experience seasonal, transient flows of liquid water or brines, underscoring the dry, desert-like nature of Mars,"" the researchers write in their conclusion. This alleviates one of the concerns about exploring regions where streaks and RSL appear. If they're wet, the potential for inadvertent contamination by Earth life has to be taken seriously. If they're dry, there's much less concern. ""This implies that slope streak and RSL locations are not likely to be habitable, alleviating strict planetary protection measures for future landed missions to those regions,"" the authors conclude. ""That's the advantage of this big data approach,"" Valantinas said. ""It helps us to rule out some hypotheses from orbit before we send spacecraft to explore.""

(CREDIT: NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA) Astronomers have long been intrigued by the makeup of the asteroid belt's largest body. When it was first spotted in 1801, Ceres appeared dry and rocky, its surface marked by craters and dents. For years, that view held strong. Most believed that Ceres was less than 30% ice and too solid to have held much water. That idea may now be outdated. Fresh findings suggest Ceres could be far more icy than scientists had guessed. New research points to a frozen past, one where the dwarf planet may have once been a muddy ocean world. The updated theory casts doubt on earlier beliefs about its dry, rocky nature. A team from Purdue University and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is behind the breakthrough. Their study, published in Nature Astronomy, proposes that up to 90% of Ceres' outer layers could be ice. Instead of solid rock, they believe the crust is dirty ice-formed as a slushy, muddy ocean froze over time. Simulated 12-km-diameter crater showing vertical displacement. (CREDIT: Nature Astronomy) PhD student Ian Pamerleau and assistant professor Mike Sori led the work. Both are part of Purdue's Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. They developed computer simulations to test how Ceres' surface has changed across billions of years. Their results hint at a hidden layer of strength beneath the dwarf planet's icy shell. Sori explained, ""We think that there's lots of water-ice near Ceres' surface, and that it gets gradually less icy as you go deeper and deeper."" He added that earlier models didn't account for how strong icy mixtures can be. Scientists once thought craters on an ice-rich body would quickly deform, behaving like honey or flowing glaciers. But when mixed with just a bit of solid rock, ice behaves differently. ""Even solids will flow over long timescales,"" said Pamerleau. ""Ice flows more readily than rock. Craters have deep bowls which produce high stresses that then relax to a lower stress state, resulting in a shallower bowl via solid state flow."" Their models show that these crater shapes can hold steady for billions of years-reshaping what we know about frozen worlds. He pointed out that NASA's Dawn mission had originally concluded that Ceres couldn't be very icy, due to the lack of shallow craters. However, their new simulations account for how a mixture of ice and rock might cause a rich ice crust to flow so slowly that the craters don't appear to change much over billions of years. The researchers found that the best explanation for the lack of crater relaxation was a gradational crust, where a high concentration of ice exists near the surface, gradually decreasing with depth. This structure would prevent significant deformation, preserving the deep craters seen today. The findings also support the idea that Ceres was once an ocean world, similar to Jupiter's moon Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus, but with a dirtier, muddier composition.

He noted, ""Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt, and a dwarf planet. I think sometimes people think of small, lumpy things as asteroids (and most of them are!), but Ceres really looks more like a planet."" Ceres has a diameter of around 950 kilometers and features common to larger planetary bodies, such as craters, volcanoes, and landslides. The discovery builds on data from NASA's Dawn mission, which orbited both Ceres and the protoplanet Vesta. Dawn was launched in 2007 and reached Ceres in 2015, continuing to orbit the dwarf planet until the mission ended in 2018. The spacecraft provided crucial data that helped the researchers refine their models of Ceres' surface and interior. ""We used multiple observations made with Dawn data as motivation for finding an ice-rich crust that resisted crater relaxation on Ceres,"" said Pamerleau. Features like pits, domes, and landslides on Ceres' surface point to the presence of ice near the subsurface. Spectrographic data from Dawn also indicated ice beneath Ceres' regolith, and gravity data showed a density close to that of impure ice. The researchers even took topographic profiles of craters to model their simulations more accurately. Per cent relaxation versus latitude for different crater sizes in our three crustal structures. (CREDIT: Nature Astronomy) Sori remarked on the significance of Ceres as a target for planetary exploration. As the largest asteroid and a potential ocean world, Ceres was a compelling candidate for a spacecraft mission. Its proximity to Earth and unique composition make it a valuable point of comparison to the ocean-hosting moons of the outer solar system, like Europa and Enceladus. ""To me the exciting part of all this, if we're right, is that we have a frozen ocean world pretty close to Earth,"" Sori said. ""Ceres may be a valuable point of comparison for the ocean-hosting icy moons of the outer solar system, like Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus. Ceres, we think, is therefore the most accessible icy world in the universe. That makes it a great target for future spacecraft missions."" The bright features on Ceres' surface are thought to be remnants of its frozen ocean, now mostly or entirely frozen solid and erupted onto the surface. These regions could provide valuable material for future missions to collect samples from an ancient ocean world. As Sori puts it, ""We have a place to collect samples from the ocean of an ancient ocean world that is not too difficult to send a spacecraft to.""

Other objects in our solar system containing water Many objects in the solar system, like Ceres, contain significant amounts of water in various forms. Europa Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, has a vast subsurface ocean covered by an icy shell. This ocean is believed to contain 2-3 times the volume of Earth's oceans. Observations from the Galileo spacecraft revealed a smooth, cracked surface, indicating liquid water beneath. Europa's magnetic field measurements further support the presence of a salty ocean, making it a prime candidate for life due to potential interactions between the ocean and the rocky mantle.

(CREDIT: NASA / JPL-Caltech) Enceladus Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, also boasts a subsurface liquid ocean beneath a 20-30 km thick ice shell. This ocean feeds plumes of water vapor and ice particles that erupt from its south pole. The Cassini spacecraft detected these plumes, which contain salts, ice grains, and organic molecules. The presence of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor enhances Enceladus's potential to support microbial life. Ganymede Another of Jupiter's moons, Ganymede , holds a subsurface ocean beneath a thick ice shell. This ocean is thought to be around 100 km deep, with several layers of ice and liquid water. Galileo spacecraft data revealed a magnetic field and auroras, indicating a conductive, salty ocean. , holds a subsurface ocean beneath a thick ice shell.

Callisto's low density and high water ice content suggest significant water reserves, potentially preserved for billions of years. Titan Saturn's moon Titan has a unique water story. Beneath its surface lies a liquid ocean, likely 50-100 km deep, covered by an icy crust.

While the exact volume is unknown, Triton's active geysers, observed by Voyager 2, suggest subsurface liquid driven by internal heat. As a captured Kuiper Belt object, Triton offers insights into the early solar system's water reservoirs. Pluto Pluto, too, may harbor a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, estimated to be 100 km thick. Data from the New Horizons mission reveal surface features indicating past or present liquid water. Thermal models suggest this ocean could remain liquid due to insulation from gas hydrates and internal heat from radioactive decay.

Spectroscopic analysis supports the presence of water, with impact models suggesting an icy interior. Hygiea offers clues about water-rich bodies in the asteroid belt and their role in delivering water to terrestrial planets. Comets Comets, often described as ""dirty snowballs,"" are composed of up to 50% water ice by mass. Spacecraft like Rosetta have detected water vapor, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds on comets such as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. These findings support the theory that comets may have played a role in delivering water to Earth. Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud objects contain significant amounts of water ice. (CREDIT: ESA) Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud Finally, the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud objects, distant icy bodies on the fringes of the solar system, contain significant amounts of water ice. Observations from missions like New Horizons reveal icy surfaces and occasional signs of sublimation. These objects are ancient reservoirs of water ice, offering invaluable insights into the conditions of the early solar system and the distribution of water throughout it. Each of these objects provides a unique opportunity to study water in various forms, helping scientists understand the solar system's history and the potential for life beyond Earth.

This extraordinary event marks a significant milestone in the conservation efforts for this ancient species, once thought to be extinct for millions of years. Prehistoric pine bears fruit in English garden The Wollemi pine, a living fossil approximately 90 million years old, has achieved something unprecedented in the Thompson's garden in Wichenford, England. The couple purchased the rare conifer at a charity auction in 2010, little knowing they would become part of botanical history. ""We were told it was like adopting a dinosaur,"" recalls 75-year-old Pamela Thompson. Their dedication to nurturing this prehistoric specimen has paid off spectacularly, as their tree has produced both male and female cones simultaneously - the essential condition for natural reproduction. Science A robotic manta ray is preparing to conquer the Antarctic depths! What will it do? The significance of this event cannot be overstated. Until now, these ancient trees had never been known to reproduce naturally outside their native Australia. Experts from Kew Gardens have expressed amazement at this development, which could potentially revolutionize conservation efforts for the species. The Wollemi pine's story mirrors other remarkable discoveries that expand our understanding of life and history. Scientists continue to make breakthrough findings, such as when essential elements for life were detected by James Webb on four exoplanets, demonstrating how discoveries can happen in the most unexpected circumstances. The remarkable story of the dinosaur-era survivor The Wollemi pine stands as one of botany's most astonishing stories. Considered extinct since the Cretaceous period, the species was dramatically rediscovered in 1994 by park ranger David Noble in a remote canyon within Australia's Wollemi National Park. The discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community, comparable to finding a living dinosaur. The tree's distinctive appearance makes it immediately recognizable. With a spongy bark resembling chocolate dessert, spiral-arranged flexible leaves, and the potential to grow up to 40 meters tall, it represents a genuine portal to prehistoric times. The species survived in complete isolation, with fewer than 100 specimens existing in the wild. Science Generation Z is losing a skill we've had for 5,500 years: 40% are losing the ability to communicate effectively. Australian authorities have kept the exact location of these wild specimens confidential to protect them from contamination and disturbance. During the devastating bushfires of 2020, helicopters were deployed specifically to douse these ancient giants, highlighting their irreplaceable value to global biodiversity. Throughout history, humans have sought to preserve remarkable artifacts and species. Just as researchers have deciphered hidden messages in 19th-century dresses, botanists are now uncovering the secrets of the Wollemi pine's survival and reproduction. Why this fruiting event represents a scientific breakthrough The appearance of fertile cones on the Thompson's Wollemi pine represents a potential game-changer for the species' survival. Prior to this event, conservation efforts relied entirely on clonal propagation - essentially creating genetic copies of existing trees. While this technique preserved the species, it created a population with minimal genetic diversity, leaving them vulnerable to diseases and environmental changes. Sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation, the cornerstone of evolutionary adaptation. If the seeds from the Thompson's tree successfully germinate, they will produce saplings with unique genetic combinations, potentially strengthening the species' resilience against future threats. Science A manuscript over 2,000 years old and buried under the ashes of Mount Vesuvius has been analyzed thanks to a new technique. ""If these seeds prove viable, it would represent nothing short of a renaissance for the species,"" explains a botanist from Kew Gardens. ""Every seed represents a potential new genetic line."" Alistair Thompson, a former surgeon, compares the waiting process to ""expecting panda babies"" - rare, precious, and with uncertain outcomes. The couple plans to share any viable seeds with botanical gardens worldwide, creating a distributed network of genetically diverse specimens. The quest to preserve Earth's remarkable biodiversity parallels humanity's other grand endeavors. Scientists have even sent legendary music into space to communicate with extraterrestrials, demonstrating our desire to share and preserve what makes our world unique. The future of prehistoric pines in modern gardens On May 4, 2025, the Thompsons will open their garden to the public, offering a rare opportunity to witness this botanical miracle firsthand. This event could spark widespread interest in private cultivation of Wollemi pines, potentially creating a global safety net for the species outside its native habitat. Science Scientists reveal the first images of the most elusive animal in the ocean! However, growing these prehistoric trees requires specific conditions. They need well-drained soil, filtered light, and protection from severe frost. ""This isn't like growing roses,"" cautions Alistair Thompson. ""It's a commitment to a living piece of Earth's history."" The story of the Thompsons and their fruiting Wollemi pine demonstrates that conservation heroes don't always wear lab coats or work in scientific institutions. Sometimes, they're retirees checking on their garden ""in pajamas, like kids on Christmas morning,"" as Pamela Thompson describes their daily ritual of monitoring the developing cones. For those inspired to grow their own piece of prehistory, Wollemi pines are occasionally available through specialized nurseries and botanical gardens. While challenging to maintain, they represent a tangible connection to a world that existed millions of years before humans walked the Earth - a living link to the age of dinosaurs, now writing a new chapter in an English garden."

DOI: 10.1039/D4NR04812A Scientists studying a promising quantum material have stumbled upon a surprise: within its crystal structure, the material naturally forms one of the world's thinnest semiconductor junctions-a building block of most modern electronics. The junction is just 3.3 nanometers thick, about 25,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. ""This was a big surprise,"" said Asst. Prof. Shuolong Yang. ""We weren't trying to make this junction, but the material made one on its own, and it's one of the thinnest we've ever seen."" The discovery offers a way to build ultra-miniaturized electronic components, and also provides insight into how electrons behave in materials designed for quantum applications. The paper, titled ""Spectroscopic evidence of intra-unit-cell charge redistribution in a charge-neutral magnetic topological insulator,"" is published in the journal Nanoscale. Uneven electrons Researchers at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (UChicago PME) and Pennsylvania State University were studying the electronic properties of MnBi6Te10, a type of topological substance known for its unusual properties-like letting electricity flow freely along its edges without any resistance. Scientists hope that this class of topological material could someday be used in quantum computers or ultra-efficient electronic devices. But to work properly, materials like MnBi6Te10 need to have carefully balanced and distributed electrons. The team thought they had achieved the right balance by tweaking the material's chemical makeup and infusing MnBi6Te10 with antimony. Regular electrical tests confirmed the material was, overall, neutral. Then Yang's team looked closer, using a technique called time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) that uses ultrafast laser pulses to observe how electrons are distributed and how their energy levels shift in real time. The scientists saw something unexpected. Within each repeating layer of the crystal-just a few atoms thick-the electrons were not evenly spread. Instead, they were clumping up in some parts and leaving other parts with fewer electrons. This created tiny built-in electric fields within the material. Researchers at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, including Asst. Prof. Shuolong Yang (left) and graduate student Khanh Duy Nguyen, have discovered one of the world's thinnest semiconductor junctions naturally forming within a promising quantum material. Credit: John Zich ""In an ideal quantum material, you want a really uniform distribution of charges,"" said UChicago PME graduate student Khanh Duy Nguyen, the first author of the new work. ""Seeing this uneven distribution suggests that we may not enable quantum applications in the originally planned fashion, but reveals this other really useful phenomenon."" These tiny regions acted like p-n junctions, a type of semiconductor junction that contains internal electric fields and is used to build diodes-similar to the ones found in everyday electronics like phones and computers. But unlike manufactured p-n junctions, these ones form naturally as part of the crystal itself. A boon for quantum and electronic applications Because the new, naturally forming p-n junction is also highly responsive to light, it could be useful for next-generation electronics, including spintronics-a type of technology that stores and manipulates data using an electron's magnetic spin rather than its charge. By modeling what was occurring within the crystal structure of MnBi6Te10, Nguyen, Yang and their colleagues were able to form a hypothesis about how it formed the p-n junctions. Introducing antimony into MnBi6Te10, they suspect, leads to swapping between manganese atoms and antimony, causing charge differences throughout the material. While the finding adds complexity to efforts to use the material for certain types of quantum effects, it opens up new applications in electronics. It also paves the way toward further engineering of MnBi6Te10 so that it does maintain evenly distributed electrons-and can be useful in quantum engineering. The UChicago PME team is fine-tuning ways of fabricating thin films of the material-rather than large, three-dimensional crystals. This could let them more precisely control the behavior of electrons, either to boost quantum properties, or to boost the yield of tiny p-n junctions. ""This once again demonstrates the value of pursuing basic, fundamental scientific research and being open about where it leads,"" said Yang. ""We set out with one goal and found a surprise that led us in another, really exciting direction.""

The image diameter corresponds to approximately 200,000 kilometers on the surface of the sun. Credit: R. Kamlah et al. 2025 Large and complex sunspot groups characterize the surface of the dynamic sun during its activity cycle. A new camera system at the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) at the Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife uses image restoration methods to capture small structures in active areas. This has resulted in unique, high-resolution images that reveal the smallest details in active regions of the sun's surface. The research is published in the journal Solar Physics. Large solar telescopes can observe the smallest details on the surface of the sun, but only in a small field of view. As a result, they miss the large-scale development of active regions. Smaller telescopes in space or in Earth-spanning networks observe the entire solar disk around the clock, but cannot zoom into the complex and rapidly changing structures that are shaped by the magnetic field. This is where the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) on Tenerife, which has been in operation since 1988, comes into play. It is characterized by a large field of view and good spatial resolution, thus closing the gap between these two types of telescopes. With the help of the new, modern camera system of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP), the entire field of view of the VTT has now been restored for the first time. For a restored image, 100 short-time-exposure images with 8,000  6,000 pixels are required, which are recorded at 25 frames per second. This means that the camera system delivers reconstructed images with an 8K image resolution for the first time. The fast image sequence makes it possible to eliminate the disturbing influences of Earth's turbulent atmosphere from the solar images.

The coloring corresponds to the observed wavelength at 430.7 nm. Credit: R. Kamlah et al. 2025 As a result, the telescope's theoretical spatial resolution of down to 100 km on the surface of the sun can be achieved. Time-lapse recordings of the restored images also enable the investigation of dynamic processes on time scales of 20 seconds. The new camera system complements the HELioseismic Large Region Interferometric Device (HELLRIDE), Laser Absolute Reference Spectrograph (LARS), and Fast Multi-line Universal Spectrograph (FaMuLUS) instruments at the VTT, which are operated by the Thuringian State Observatory Tautenburg (TLS), the Institute for Solar Physics (KIS) in Freiburg, and the AIP, respectively. ""In order to better understand solar activity, it is crucial not only to analyze the fundamental processes of the fine structure and the long-term development of global activity with various instruments,"" says Rolf Schlichenmaier, scientist at the KIS, ""but also to investigate the temporal evolution of the magnetic field in active regions."" The new images show areas that correspond to around 1/7 of the sun's diameter, i.e., around 200,000 km. This makes it possible to observe large-scale structures of the active sun such as plasma motions and sunspot groups. In comparison, large telescopes typically only provide image fields of around 75,000 km in diameter. ""Our expectations of the camera system were more than fulfilled right from the start,"" says Robert Kamlah, who carried out the project as part of his doctoral thesis at the AIP and the University of Potsdam. The G-band observations demonstrated how the sunspots are embedded in the supergranulation, i.e., a large-scale convective pattern. The non-radial orientation and twist of the penumbral filaments revealed the complex magnetic field structure, which was responsible for three major and many minor flares in the active region. By using special filters, the smallest magnetic field signatures become visible as bright structures in the solar images. Time series in the light of the singly ionized calcium line at 393.3 nm and in the Fraunhofer G-band at 430.7 nm enabled the identification of areas with increased activity and the tracking of plasma motions in the active regions in two layers of the solar atmosphere (photosphere and transition to the chromosphere). In addition, the researchers investigated methods for measuring image and observation quality. ""The results obtained show how, together with our partners, we are teaching an old telescope new tricks,"" says Carsten Denker, head of the Solar Physics Section at the AIP. Telescopes like the VTT can make important contributions to the study of solar activity, especially when information about a large active region and its surroundings must be captured, such as during solar flares and other eruptive events as part of space weather forecasting. In the future, low-cost CMOS camera systems with 8K image resolution will also play an important role for the next generation of instruments on 4-meter solar telescopes, as they will triple the field of view of current 4K camera systems.

A new look at Magellan data has revealed a shocking hint that Venus may be more alive' than previously thought. Scientists have uncovered fresh evidence that Venus is not dead - geologically speaking. Venus and Earth are similar in size and were bombarded by comparable amounts of water billions of years ago. This shared origin has long fueled one of planetary science's biggest questions: Why did Venus become a hellish, uninhabitable world while Earth flourished into a cradle for life? Now, more than three decades after NASA's Magellan spacecraft mapped Venus' surface, scientists have found signs of hot material rising from the planet's interior, indicating that its crust is still being sculpted from within. The findings, published May 14 in the journal Science Advances , add to a growing body of evidence that Venus, despite lacking Earth's plate tectonics, may share more internal dynamics with our planet than scientists previously thought. Related: Molecule responsible for robbing Venus of its water may finally have been identified ""This research has provided a new and important insight into the possible subsurface processes currently shaping the surface of Venus,"" Gael Cascioli , an assistant research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland who co-led the new study, said in a statement . ""We could hardly believe our eyes"" The latest evidence focuses on dozens of large, ring-shaped features on Venus' surface. These features, known as coronae, form when plumes of hot rock rise from deep within the mantle, pushing the crust upward. As the surface cools and collapses, a circular structure is left behind. Cascioli and his team simulated several formation scenarios for these features and compared their results with data from Magellan.

""We can now say there are most likely various and ongoing active processes driving their formation,"" Anna Gulcher , a planetary scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland who co-led the new study, said in the statement. ""We believe these same processes may have occurred early in Earth's history."" Venus hosts hundreds of such coronae , many of which are found in areas where the planet's crust is particularly thin and heat from below is high. Recent research simulated how different rock types behave under Venus' extreme conditions. The findings suggest that the planet's crust may break off or melt once it reaches around 40 miles (65 kilometers) thick, and in many areas, it is likely even thinner. This image shows large, ring-shaped coronae on Venus. New research reveals these features are actively being shaped with hot material rising from below, offering new clues to geological activity on the hellish planet. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech) (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech) ""That is surprisingly thin, given conditions on the planet,"" Justin Filiberto , deputy chief of NASA's Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Division in Houston, who co-authored the study about Venus' crust, said in a different statement . This shedding or melting of the crust not only helps regulate Venus' surface structure but could also recycle water and other materials back into the planet's interior, potentially fueling volcanic activity and influencing its atmosphere, Filiberto explained. ""It resets the playing field for how the geology, crust and atmosphere on Venus work together,"" he said. These recent findings offer testable predictions for upcoming missions to Venus that will gather direct data about the planet's crust and geology to refine existing models. Scientists aim to pinpoint areas of surface activity using data from NASA's VERITAS mission, which will map the planet's surface at a resolution two to four times higher than previous missions. Another NASA mission, DAVINCI, slated for 2029, will focus on studying Venus' atmosphere and surface chemistry, while the European Space Agency's EnVision mission, targeted for 2030, will provide high-resolution surface mapping."

A new study published in the journal Archaeologies uncovers the technological and cultural shifts linked to a specialized stone tool known as the Quina scraper. These findings shed light on how early humans responded to shrinking megafauna by redesigning their tools and hunting strategies in ways that echo through human history. The Shift In Prey And Its Impact On Early Humans For nearly a million years, prehistoric hunters in the Levant primarily targeted large game, such as elephants that roamed vast plains stretching from Africa to Eurasia. As elephant populations declined, early humans were forced to shift their diet towards smaller, faster animals like fallow deer. This change demanded new approaches both in hunting strategy and tool design. Fallow deer thrived in mixed woodlands along the Samarian highlands, and their remains have been found in large quantities at the Jaljulia and Qesem Cave sites. Processing many smaller animals to match the calories provided by a single elephant was a complex task, requiring tools with sharper, more efficient edges. This Ancient Blade Was the iPhone of the Stone Age The Quina scraper is a small but highly specialized flint tool distinguished by its scalloped, razor-sharp edge designed for efficient skinning and butchering. Microscopic wear analysis shows repeated motions suited for removing hide and sinew cleanly and quickly, reducing exposure to scavengers and competitors at kill sites. ""We see the emergence of the new Quina scrapers, with a better-shaped, sharper, more uniform working edge compared to the simple scrapers used previously,"" Vlad Litov, the study's lead author. Unlike earlier scrapers, the Quina scraper features a stepped, scale-like working edge with a keen bevel that could be resharpened multiple times, making it a reliable tool on long hunting expeditions. Experimental archaeology confirms its effectiveness in producing long strips of hide ideal for shelter construction, meat wrapping, or even early garment making. Credit: Tel Aviv University Why Did Early Humans Ignore Closer Flint? One of the study's most intriguing discoveries is the source of the flint used to make these scrapers. Instead of utilizing closer flint outcrops, early humans transported flint approximately 12.4 miles from the western slopes of the Samarian mountains. These same uplands were prime calving grounds for fallow deer. This deliberate pairing of resource and landscape suggests a sophisticated awareness of the environment, where tool-making materials and prey were linked spatially and perhaps symbolically. Researchers Vlad Litov and Prof. Ran Barkai from Tel Aviv University propose that this behavior indicates an early form of landscape attachment, possibly sacred in nature, that influenced both practical and perceptual aspects of prehistoric life. What A Flint Blade Tells Us About Being Human The association of a tool's material origin with the location of its prey highlights a deeper cultural significance beyond survival. This connection between resource and place echoes similar patterns seen throughout human history, from obsidian use in the American Southwest to jade sourcing in ancient China. Such findings push back the timeline for symbolic and cultural behavior, revealing that early humans not only adapted their technology to environmental pressures but also developed complex relationships with their surroundings."
A Massive Solar Storm Could Throw America Into Complete Chaos — This Drill Just Proved It - The Daily Galaxy,science,The U.S. just tested its response to a devastating solar storm — but the real event could be far worse than anyone imagined.,Unknown,The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel,2025-05-20T18:30:00+00:00,"A recent inter-agency emergency drill has revealed serious vulnerabilities in the United States' preparedness for a severe solar storm that could disrupt critical infrastructure and national security.

The exercise, organized by the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation (SWORM) task force, brought together multiple U.S. agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to simulate a major geomagnetic storm scenario. The results, published in a detailed report following the drill held in May 2024, underscore significant limitations in the nation's ability to forecast and respond effectively to extreme space weather events. What the Solar Storm Emergency Drill Entailed The exercise took place over two days at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland and a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) site in Denver, Colorado. It involved four modules that simulated a series of solar events, including coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that led to widespread impacts on Earth's technological systems. Participants were asked to respond to a hypothetical eight-day period in early 2028 during which an active solar region emitted a large CME directed toward Earth. Key challenges presented during the drill included radio communication blackouts, loss of GPS functionality, power grid outages, intense radiation risks for astronauts and satellites, and difficulties in tracking and communicating with orbiting spacecraft. These complications were exacerbated by the presence of Artemis mission crews en route to and on the lunar surface, highlighting the stakes of space weather for human spaceflight. Why Space Weather Forecasting Falls Short One of the most pressing issues exposed by the exercise is the inability to accurately predict the magnetic composition and severity of incoming CMEs until they are extremely close to Earth - often just 15 to 45 minutes away. Shawn Dahl, service coordinator at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, explains that this short warning window leaves little time for authorities and infrastructure operators to take protective measures. The report emphasizes that current forecasting technologies do not allow scientists to determine the true impact of a CME until it nears Earth's orbit. This limitation drastically reduces the effectiveness of emergency response plans and increases the risk of severe damage. Credit: ESA/SOHO The May 2024 Geomagnetic Storm: A Stark Reminder Coinciding almost exactly with the timing of the drill, Earth experienced a G5-class geomagnetic storm - the most intense in over two decades - caused by massive plasma expulsions from the Sun. The event disrupted power grids in some regions and triggered spectacular auroras visible across large swaths of the globe. It also caused a significant increase in atmospheric density in low Earth orbit, leading to atmospheric drag that affected the orbits of many satellites. This real-world storm served as a test case for understanding the vulnerabilities faced by satellite operations and power infrastructure in the face of extreme space weather. Recommendations for Strengthening U.S. Space Weather Preparedness The drill's report calls for substantial investment in next-generation space weather monitoring satellites and a wider deployment of sensors to improve real-time tracking of solar activity. It also urges enhanced collaboration between U.S. federal agencies, private sector partners, and international allies to develop coordinated response strategies. The report emphasizes the importance of approaching space weather events with the same level of urgency as other natural disasters: ""Ongoing preparedness efforts for a space weather event are crucial because an extreme event has the potential to severely impact our nation's critical infrastructure and threaten our national security. Just as we prepare for earthquakes, hurricanes and cyberattacks, our nation must take action before a major space weather event occurs."""
Scientists Discover Hidden Dinosaur Mass Grave Full of Thousands of Fossils - Indian Defence Review,science,Scientists have uncovered a mysterious dinosaur mass grave containing thousands of perfectly preserved bones — and the secrets it holds could change everything we know about prehistoric life!,Unknown,Indiandefencereview.com,2025-05-20T18:15:00+00:00,"A remarkable discovery in Alberta, Canada, has unveiled one of the largest dinosaur bone beds ever found in North America, providing scientists with a unique glimpse into prehistoric life.

This finding, detailed by the BBC, centers on a mass grave containing thousands of fossils of Pachyrhinosaurus dinosaurs. These creatures, relatives of the Triceratops, perished around 73 million years ago in what is now known as Pipestone Creek, a site nicknamed the ""River of Death."" The scale and preservation of this grave present an unparalleled opportunity for researchers to study a complete dinosaur community from a single moment in time, a rarity in the fossil record. An Extraordinary Density of Fossils Offers Unprecedented Research Potential The excavation site at Pipestone Creek has stunned paleontologists with the sheer concentration of bones packed into a relatively small area. Professor Emily Bamforth, leading the dig, describes the site as ""jaw dropping in terms of its density,"" highlighting how skeletons are layered one upon another, creating a compact bone bed extending over a kilometer. ""That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,"" she explains, accompanied by her dog Aster, whose role includes alerting the team to potential bear encounters. Among the fossils uncovered are ""long, skinny bones"" identified as ribs and smaller, more puzzling finds like parts of toe bones. Some elements remain mysterious, which Professor Bamforth refers to as ""a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery."" The richness of the site marks it as a vital resource, possibly one of the largest such collections in North America, destined to expand current understanding of dinosaur anatomy and behavior. A hip bone of a Pachyrhinosaur is one of thousands of discoveries in the creek Credit: Kevin Church/BBC News A Snapshot of a Single Species From a Specific Moment in Prehistoric Time What makes the Pipestone Creek bonebed exceptional is that it represents a ""single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time,"" according to Professor Bamforth. The site predominantly contains fossils of Pachyrhinosaurus, a ceratopsid dinosaur known for its distinctive nasal bump and three horns. This mass death event likely occurred due to a catastrophic flood during a mass migration, where the herd, traveling north for summer, was caught off guard. Such a scenario explains why thousands of individuals died together, their remains subsequently preserved in fine detail. With ""more than half of the known dinosaur species in the world described from a single specimen,"" having thousands of bones from the same species offers an extraordinary sample size rarely found in paleontology, providing deeper insights into population structure, variation, and species ecology. Pipestone Creek still holds many secrets Credit: Kevin Church/BBC News Ongoing Research Promises to Unlock More Secrets From the ""River of Death"" Work at the Pipestone Creek site is far from complete. The excavation covers an area comparable to a tennis court so far, but the entire bonebed stretches for about a kilometer, meaning significant fossil recovery lies ahead. After the painstaking extraction, the fossils will undergo detailed cleaning and analysis at the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum, which oversees the project. The museum's team has already collected approximately 8,000 bones from Pachyrhinosaurus and other coexisting herbivores like Edmontosaurus. These efforts are expected to illuminate not only the anatomy and life history of these dinosaurs but also paleoecological conditions of the late Cretaceous period in what is now western Canada. This site, first discovered in 1973 by a local science teacher, continues to captivate the scientific community with its ability to offer a vivid window into prehistoric life."

This discovery centers around the remarkably preserved remains of a child who lived approximately 28,000 years ago, a crucial find that sheds light on our complex evolutionary history. Uncovering The Story Behind The Ancient Burial According to the study published in Science Advances, the child's remains were found 27 years ago, immediately sparking interest because the skeleton displayed physical traits characteristic of both Neanderthals and modern humans. This mix suggested that the two populations had offspring together, a theory now strongly supported by genetic studies showing that much of today's human population carries Neanderthal DNA. Bethan Linscott from the University of Miami, involved in the recent dating efforts, described the experience: """"Being able to successfully date the child felt like giving them back a tiny piece of their story, which is a huge privilege."" The child, likely around four years old, was buried with red pigment on the bones, indicating a deliberate burial that may have held cultural or symbolic meaning. Dating Challenges Overcome With New Techniques For years, dating the child's remains proved difficult due to contamination from roots and soil, which made radiocarbon dating unreliable. However, researchers recently applied an innovative method that isolates hydroxyproline, an amino acid essential in bone collagen. This approach successfully avoided contamination and produced a more accurate age estimate, confirming the child lived roughly 28,000 years ago-a time when both Neanderthals and modern humans occupied Europe. This Ancient Child's Bones Reveal A Shocking Secret Analysis of the skeleton's proportions revealed a fascinating blend: the limb bones resembled those typical of Neanderthals, while the skull and jaw had traits closer to modern humans. This mixture provides strong evidence for ancient interbreeding and suggests early hybrid individuals were integrated into their communities. The burial itself reflected cultural practices that may have been common across human groups at the time. The presence of red ochre staining, animal skin wrapping, and nearby artifacts such as a juvenile rabbit bone and charcoal traces point to intentional rituals tied to mourning or belief. Anthropologists emphasize that such discoveries demonstrate how different human populations shared symbolic behaviors, underscoring the complexity of their social lives. Credit: (A) J.Z. and (B) G. Casella/ Science Advances New Discoveries Turn Ancient Burial Story Upside Down Initially, two red deer bones found near the child's grave were thought to be part of a funeral ritual. However, new dating shows these bones predate the child's burial, suggesting they were already in the ground and likely moved accidentally or used to support the body during interment. Similarly, charcoal beneath the child's legs, once believed to mark a ritual fire, is now known to be at least 150 years older, indicating it was part of earlier activity in the shelter rather than related to the burial ceremony. Researchers hope to apply these advanced dating techniques to other ancient remains that have been difficult to study. By doing so, they aim to unravel more about how early humans migrated, interacted, and blended with different groups across Europe."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: Credit: CC0 Public Domain My telescope, set up for astrophotography in my light-polluted San Diego backyard, was pointed at a galaxy unfathomably far from Earth. My wife, Cristina, walked up just as the first space photo streamed to my tablet. It sparkled on the screen in front of us. ""That's the Pinwheel galaxy,"" I said. The name is derived from its shape-albeit this pinwheel contains about a trillion stars. The light from the Pinwheel traveled for 25 million years across the universe-about 150 quintillion miles-to get to my telescope. My wife wondered: ""Doesn't light get tired during such a long journey?"" Her curiosity triggered a thought-provoking conversation about light. Ultimately, why doesn't light wear out and lose energy over time? Let's talk about light I am an astrophysicist, and one of the first things I learned in my studies is how light often behaves in ways that defy our intuitions. Light is electromagnetic radiation: basically, an electric wave and a magnetic wave coupled together and traveling through space-time. It has no mass. That point is critical because the mass of an object, whether a speck of dust or a spaceship, limits the top speed it can travel through space. But because light is massless, it's able to reach the maximum speed limit in a vacuum-about 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second, or almost 6 trillion miles per year (9.6 trillion kilometers). Nothing traveling through space is faster. To put that into perspective: In the time it takes you to blink your eyes, a particle of light travels around the circumference of Earth more than twice. As incredibly fast as that is, space is incredibly spread out. Light from the sun, which is 93 million miles (about 150 million kilometers) from Earth, takes just over eight minutes to reach us. In other words, the sunlight you see is eight minutes old. Alpha Centauri, the nearest star to us after the sun, is 26 trillion miles away (about 41 trillion kilometers). So by the time you see it in the night sky, its light is just over four years old. Or, as astronomers say, it's four light years away. With those enormous distances in mind, consider Cristina's question: How can light travel across the universe and not slowly lose energy? Actually, some light does lose energy. This happens when it bounces off something, such as interstellar dust, and is scattered about. But most light just goes and goes, without colliding with anything. This is almost always the case because space is mostly empty-nothingness. So there's nothing in the way. When light travels unimpeded, it loses no energy. It can maintain that 186,000-mile-per-second speed forever. Discover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

It's about time Here's another concept: Picture yourself as an astronaut on board the International Space Station. You're orbiting at 17,000 miles (about 27,000 kilometers) per hour. Compared with someone on Earth, your wristwatch will tick 0.01 seconds slower over one year. That's an example of time dilation-time moving at different speeds under different conditions. If you're moving really fast, or close to a large gravitational field, your clock will tick more slowly than someone moving slower than you, or who is farther from a large gravitational field. To say it succinctly, time is relative. Now consider that light is inextricably connected to time. Picture sitting on a photon, a fundamental particle of light; here, you'd experience maximum time dilation. Everyone on Earth would clock you at the speed of light, but from your reference frame, time would completely stop. That's because the ""clocks"" measuring time are in two different places going vastly different speeds: the photon moving at the speed of light, and the comparatively slowpoke speed of Earth going around the sun. What's more, when you're traveling at or close to the speed of light, the distance between where you are and where you're going gets shorter. That is, space itself becomes more compact in the direction of motion-so the faster you can go, the shorter your journey has to be. In other words, for the photon, space gets squished. Which brings us back to my picture of the Pinwheel galaxy. From the photon's perspective, a star within the galaxy emitted it, and then a single pixel in my backyard camera absorbed it, at exactly the same time. Because space is squished, to the photon the journey was infinitely fast and infinitely short, a tiny fraction of a second. But from our perspective on Earth, the photon left the galaxy 25 million years ago and traveled 25 million light years across space until it landed on my tablet in my backyard. And there, on a cool spring night, its stunning image inspired a delightful conversation between a nerdy scientist and his curious wife.

"Universe may end much sooner than predicted, say theorists - Physics World",science,New estimate suggests that the most persistent stellar objects may decay away via Hawking radiation within the next 1078 years,Margaret Harris,physicsworld.com,2025-05-20T16:18:45+00:00,"Going, going gone: Artist's impression of a neutron star that is ""evaporating"" slowly via a process similar to Hawking radiation.

(Courtesy: Danielle Futselaar/artsource.nl) The universe's maximum lifespan may be considerably shorter than was previously thought, but don't worry: there's still plenty of time to finish streaming your favourite TV series. According to new calculations by black hole expert Heino Falcke, quantum physicist Michael Wondrak, and mathematician Walter van Suijlekom of Radboud University in the Netherlands, the most persistent stellar objects in the universe - white dwarf stars - will decay away to nothingness in around 1078 years. This, Falcke admits, is ""a very long time"", but it's a far cry from previous predictions, which suggested that white dwarfs could persist for at least 101100 years. ""The ultimate end of the universe comes much sooner than expected,"" he says. Writing in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, Falcke and colleagues explain that the discrepancy stems from different assumptions about how white dwarfs decay. Previous calculations of their lifetime assumed that, in the absence of proton decay (which has never been observed experimentally), their main decay process would be something called pyconuclear fusion. This form of fusion occurs when nuclei in a crystalline lattice essentially vibrate their way into becoming fused with their nearest neighbours. If that sounds a little unlikely, that's because it is. However, in the dense, cold cores of white dwarf stars, and over stupendously long time periods, pyconuclear fusion happens often enough to gradually (very, very gradually) turn the white dwarf's carbon into nickel, which then transmutes into iron by emitting a positron. The resulting iron-cored stars are known as black dwarfs, and some theories predict that they will eventually (very, very eventually) collapse into black holes. Depending on how massive they were to start with, the whole process takes between 1011001032 000 years. An alternative mechanism Those estimates, however, do not take into account an alternative decay mechanism known as Hawking radiation. First proposed in the early 1970s by Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein, Hawking radiation arises from fluctuations in the vacuum of spacetime. These fluctuations allow particle-antiparticle pairs to pop into existence by essentially ""borrowing"" energy from the vacuum for brief periods before the pairs recombine and annihilate. If this pair production happens in the vicinity of a black hole, one particle in the pair may stray over the black hole's event horizon before it can recombine. This leaves its partner free to carry away some of the ""borrowed"" energy as Hawking radiation. After an exceptionally long time - but, crucially, not as long as the time required to disappear a white dwarf via pyconuclear fusion - Hawking radiation will therefore cause black holes to dissipate. The fate of life, the universe and everything? But what about objects other than black holes? Well, in a previous work published in 2023, Falcke, Wondrak and van Suijlekom showed that a similar process can occur for any object that curves spacetime with its gravitational field, not just objects that have an event horizon. This means that white dwarfs, neutron stars, the Moon and even human beings can, in principle, evaporate away into nothingness via Hawking radiation - assuming that what the trio delicately call ""other astrophysical evolution and decay channels"" don't get there first. Based on this tongue-in-cheek assumption, the trio calculated that white dwarfs will dissipate in around 1078 years, while denser objects such as black holes and neutron stars will vanish in no more than 1067 years. Less dense objects such as humans, meanwhile, could persist for as long as 1090 years - albeit only in a vast, near-featureless spacetime devoid of anything that would make life worth living, or indeed possible. While that might sound unrealistic as well as morbid, the trio's calculations do have a somewhat practical goal. ""By asking these kinds of questions and looking at extreme cases, we want to better understand the theory,"" van Suijlekom says. ""Perhaps one day, we [will] unravel the mystery of Hawking radiation."""

The Celestron NexStar 4SE is ideal for beginners wanting quality, reliable and quick views of celestial objects. For a more in-depth look at our Celestron NexStar 4SE review. The rocky body was discovered on May 19 by astronomers at the MAP project in Chile's Atacama Desert, according to the Minor Planet Center, just a few days ahead of its close approach. Asteroid 2025 KF is estimated to have a diameter ranging between 32 and 75 feet (10 - 23 meters), making it approximately the size of a house. Even if 2025 KF were to hit Earth, its small size means that it would likely burn up in the atmosphere, posing zero threat to those living on our planet, per NASA. NASA has catalogued close to 40,000 near-Earth asteroids since it began watching the skies for potentially hazardous objects back in the summer of 1998, and we know today that close passes with automobile-sized asteroids occur on a yearly basis. Of that number, around 4,700 are classified as potentially dangerous asteroids, though scientists at the Center for Near Earth Object Studies have said that it's unlikely that any asteroid capable of causing widespread damage to Earth will strike our planet in the next century.

This layer in the stratosphere acts as Earth's natural sunscreen, absorbing harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays that can cause serious health issues such as skin cancer, DNA damage, and cataracts, as well as disrupt ecosystems. Drawing on research and insights from the British Antarctic Survey, the very team behind this groundbreaking discovery, the history, causes, and current state of the ozone hole are explored in detail. The Discovery and Its Global Impact The ozone hole was first identified in 1985 by scientists at the British Antarctic Survey. Their research revealed a dramatic thinning of the ozone layer over Antarctica during the Southern Hemisphere's spring months, primarily from August to October. This finding shocked the scientific community and policy makers worldwide. Dominic Hodgson, interim director of science at BAS, described the discovery as ""one of the most important environmental discoveries of the 20th century,"" highlighting how it demonstrated the power of ""robust science, clear communication and international cooperation"" to address threats on a planetary scale. Jon Shanklin, one of the lead scientists behind the initial study and now an emeritus fellow at BAS, recalled that when their results were published they had no idea how the world would respond. The identification of the ozone hole led to swift international action, culminating in the Montreal Protocol in 1987. This groundbreaking treaty committed countries to freeze production of ozone-depleting chemicals at 1986 levels and then phase them out completely. The treaty is often cited as one of the most successful environmental agreements in history, significantly reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other harmful substances. A false-color view of ozone over Anarctica is seen in an image released in 2012. The purple and blue colors are where there is the least ozone, and the yellows and reds are where there is more ozone The hole in the ozone layer was discovered 40 years ago, in May 1985. (NASA/ REUTERS) The Science Behind Ozone Depletion Ozone in the stratosphere protects life on Earth by filtering out ultraviolet radiation. The ozone layer is naturally replenished but can be broken down by certain chemicals. The primary culprits behind the ozone hole are CFCs, which were widely used in refrigeration, aerosols, solvents, and fire extinguishers. When these chemicals reach the stratosphere, UV rays break them down, releasing chlorine and bromine atoms. These atoms then react with ozone molecules, causing them to break apart. This destruction occurs faster than the ozone can naturally regenerate, leading to thinning of the layer. The ozone hole forms every Antarctic spring when the region experiences extremely cold temperatures that create polar stratospheric clouds. These clouds provide surfaces for chlorine and bromine reactions, accelerating ozone depletion. The hole typically reaches its largest and deepest extent by late September before healing during the summer months. Progress and Challenges in Ozone Layer Recovery Despite ongoing efforts and international cooperation, the recovery of the ozone layer is gradual. In an email to USA Today, Jon Shanklin explained that ""the current rate of recovery is a bit slower than might be expected,"" suggesting this may be linked to interactions with climate change. This indicates that the climate system's complexity could be influencing how quickly the ozone layer rebounds. While the Montreal Protocol has been effective in reducing emissions of ozone-depleting substances, many of these chemicals have atmospheric lifetimes exceeding 50 years. As a result, even with no further emissions, a full recovery of the ozone layer may not occur until after 2070. The ongoing presence of a large and deep ozone hole every Antarctic spring means that ultraviolet radiation risks persist for decades. Continuous monitoring and research remain essential to understand how climate change feedbacks may be altering the ozone healing process. Lessons From the Ozone Hole for Global Environmental Action The international response to the ozone crisis serves as a powerful example of what can be achieved when science, diplomacy, and policy converge. The Montreal Protocol has not only protected the ozone layer but also prevented millions of cases of skin cancer and other health issues. Dominic Hodgson emphasized how the discovery and response ""demonstrate how robust science, clear communication and international cooperation can address planetary-scale threats."" This stands in stark contrast with the slower progress in other areas such as climate change mitigation, biodiversity loss, and pollution control. Jon Shanklin remarked on the discrepancy, noting that the economic models underlying global resource use often ignore environmental costs, fueling many current crises that could otherwise be avoided. The ozone hole story offers hope that coordinated, evidence-based action can make a real difference in protecting Earth's environment - provided the global community commits to similar resolve and cooperation in other pressing challenges."
Scientists Discovered a Lost Planet Hidden Deep Inside Earth’s Mantle - The Daily Galaxy,science,Deep beneath our feet lies the shocking discovery of a lost planet’s remains hidden inside Earth’s mantle—redefining our planet’s violent origins.,Unknown,The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel,2025-05-20T14:00:00+00:00,"A recent study published in Nature presents compelling evidence of ancient planetary material buried deep within Earth's mantle.

Researchers have uncovered two massive dense structures beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean, which may represent the remnants of an ancient planetary body named Theia. This hypothesis offers new insights into the violent early history of our planet and the cosmic collisions that shaped the formation of the Earth-Moon system. By combining advanced seismic imaging techniques with state-of-the-art computer simulations, the research team has opened a fresh chapter in understanding Earth's internal composition and geological evolution. Understanding Large Low-Velocity Provinces and Their Significance Large low-velocity provinces, or LLVPs, are enigmatic features located near the boundary between Earth's lower mantle and outer core. These enormous zones span thousands of kilometers and are characterized by their unique ability to slow down seismic waves passing through them. This unusual seismic behavior suggests that LLVPs possess a composition markedly different from the surrounding mantle, possibly enriched in iron or other dense materials. The origins of these provinces have been debated for decades, with prevailing theories proposing that they consist either of ancient subducted tectonic plates or primordial material from Earth's formation. The recent study introduces a radical explanation: that LLVPs are actually the iron-rich mantle fragments of Theia, a planetary body that collided with Earth billions of years ago. This discovery has profound implications for interpreting the geological and geophysical anomalies deep within Earth's interior. Illustration of the location of the two large, dense ""blobs"" of iron-rich material near the Earth's core. One is underneath the African continent while the other is across the globe beneath the Pacific Ocean. Each blob is nearly twice the size of the Moon. Earth's core is illustrated as a gray sphere. (CREDIT: Edward Garnero) Theia's Giant Impact and Its Role in Earth's Formation The giant-impact hypothesis is widely accepted as the explanation for the formation of the Moon, positing that a Mars-sized planet named Theia collided with the early Earth approximately 4.5 billion years ago. This colossal impact ejected vast amounts of debris that eventually coalesced into the Moon, while reshaping Earth's internal structure. However, the fate of Theia's mantle material remained unclear until now. The new research demonstrates that much of Theia's iron-rich mantle did not mix evenly with Earth's mantle but instead sank deep into the lower mantle, forming the dense LLVPs observed today. These findings help explain discrepancies in Earth's deep interior composition and offer a tangible link between a primordial planetary collision and modern geophysical structures. Understanding this process sheds light on how early planetary impacts can have lasting effects on planetary interiors. Advanced Simulations Reveal the Fate of Theia's Mantle Material The discovery was made possible through sophisticated computational simulations led by Caltech researchers, including Qian Yuan. These models simulate the dynamics of the giant-impact event and the subsequent distribution of Theia's mantle material within Earth's interior. The results indicate that Theia's denser iron-rich fragments were shielded by the cooler lower mantle, which absorbed less collision energy, allowing these fragments to sink and accumulate near the core-mantle boundary. This contrasts with previous assumptions that Theia's material would disperse uniformly. The stable, dense blobs that formed correspond spatially to the African and Pacific LLVPs mapped through seismic tomography. This finding provides a rare glimpse into geological processes occurring at depths inaccessible to direct observation and explains why these structures have remained stable over billions of years. Broader Implications for Planetary Evolution and Earth Sciences Identifying LLVPs as relics of Theia's mantle carries profound implications for both Earth sciences and planetary evolution theories. The presence of iron-rich, dense structures at the core-mantle boundary influences mantle convection patterns, which in turn impact tectonic plate movements and the generation of Earth's magnetic field. Moreover, the study suggests that other terrestrial planets and moons, which also experienced giant impacts during their formation, may harbor similar hidden structures. These insights can help researchers better understand how large-scale planetary collisions contribute to the internal differentiation and long-term evolution of planetary bodies. The findings also prompt a reevaluation of the role such relics play in shaping geological and geodynamic phenomena observable on planetary surfaces today."

Sanders told Kay Adams at the NFLPA Rookie Premiere that the players are ""different characters,"" but that he's been learning from his more experienced teammates as they work to get ready or the 2025 season. ""Everybody's cool in the room,"" Sanders said. ""Outside the room, people try to pit us against each other, but, inside the room, we know we're one."" The early phases of the offseason program focus on conditioning work and learning the offense, so things will be heating up with the team on the field for OTAs, minicamp and training camp. That may lead to some changes in how everyone approaches one another and the Browns will be hoping that the setup pushes all the participants to their best."

""People ask me all the time, 'How do you determine what you are going to wear?' I say it's because I always dress for the mission."" Sherwin Williams The outfit he designed for Bueckers features a very specific color -- Sherwin-Williams' Radiant Lilac SW 0074. That is officially this year's least popular color, also known as The Loneliest Color of 2025.

""Just inspire people to be their most confident selves, not care about the opinions of others because they can't touch you when you are your most confident self.

In an exclusive interview with FOX Sports' Jamie Little, Penske said he was ""totally disappointed"" by the violations, which marked Team Penske's second major technical violation over the last two years, and that he ""didn't help"" the integrity of INDYCAR. That led Team Penske to dismiss three of its top executives on Wednesday: longtime executive Tim Cindric from the Team Penske race team organization, INDYCAR managing director Ron Ruzewski and general manager Kyle Moyer. ""I'll really have to go back four-and-a-half years ago when we bought the speedway and I said, No. 1, that I would invest capital, get the best people and we'd take the series IMSP and certainly in [the] motorspeedway into higher levels.' I think we've done that. Then, I look at my right hand, and I say, What about Team Penske?' When I think about Team Penske, we really have had an organizational failure two times. Not once, but two times,"" Penske told Little when asked what his response was to the news of the violations. ""Believe me, it hurts me in my gut when you think about it. But I look at it this way: There's a certain amount of credibility you have to have - it's integrity, individually and collectively, our team and the sport. I think we let people down. I made some management changes that we announced today and I think we'll move on. Our goal is to win the race this upcoming weekend."" Penske doesn't believe there are any conflicts of interest involved in this situation, but admitted that his side hasn't done a good job of presenting itself in the right manner. ""I would say this, as I look at my response to that and what my M.O. has been over the last four-and-a-half years: I've not been on a pit box. I've not been in race control. I'm not in inspections. I've got nothing to do with officiating, especially with the rules,"" Penske said when asked about potential conflicts of interest. ""No. 1, I can look at myself in the mirror and say, I've done the right thing.' Obviously, we have not done a good job in the optics in the people outside of this. These two violations certainly show that I need to be more diligent and where we're going as a team. ""I would challenge, if we go back and look at what we've tried to accomplish and we've made a lot of progress, but I think this independence is very important for the credibility of the series, teams, everyone else and the fans that follow INDYCAR."" As Penske's officiating body was the one that found the violations with Newgarten and Power's vehicles, Penske seemed open to the idea of an outside officiating operation governing the INDYCAR series. ""For probably the last six months, we've talked internally as INDYCAR, Mark Miles and Doug Boles, and some outside input on how we can be more independent from the operational side of the racing - inspection, race control, etc. - so we certainly expect, and I would expect, that the team at INDYCAR and PE will take a look at that and we may take some action as we move forward,"" Penske said. However, Penske vehemently disagreed with the idea that Newgarten and Power should be barred from Sunday's race. The two drivers will be sent to the rear of the field for the 109th Indy 500, instead. ""Those cars went through inspection on Saturday, got the sticker, they performed in the top 12 and were available to run on Sunday,"" Penske said. ""From that point on, there was a question about our cars on Sunday - we actually pulled a car and did not make a run because of the question from the officials. But as far as I'm concerned, they've earned the right to be in the 109th Running of the Indy 500."" Newgarten enters the weekend as the two-time defending Indy 500 champion. His 2024 car had the same modifications to the attenuator that the two penalized cars on Sunday did. Penske explained why the cars looked similar. ""I would say we had nine attenuators that were modified by Dallara at the beginning of 2024, and those have been rotated through the cars over the last 15 months,"" Penske said. ""We also had newer ones that we bought and those have been in the same batch. That's why you see that [Scott] McLaughlin didn't have an issue with his car. From my perspective, when you think about the attenuators and what happened there, my question to you is: What would we do? We know the situation was not right from the standpoint from the officials on Sunday. ""But when I go back to 2024, that car was taken apart piece by piece in detail following the race and it was said to be completely legal for the win."" Penske said that he had a call with other team owners to go through the process about what happened over the weekend. He shared what his message to the owners was to Little. ""People have come to me and said, You're supposed to be a leader of this sport and here you have these two situations.' I think the integrity of this sport, I didn't help it any,"" Penske said. ""From my perspective, what I've got to do, and I told this to the team owners, I've got to take the role on, along with the Penske Entertainment leadership, and gain back that credibility. I know that the speedway here this weekend is a world-class event, the best racing event in the world - and the last thing I want to do is tarnish it with any kind of issues from the standpoint of any inspections or any rules violations. ""So, my thinking is we've got to make it better. I have to help do that in a way that I'm not affecting anything beneficial for our team."" Now, Penske is focused on race day.

(Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) Nate Diaz has added another out-of-competition brawl to his ever-growing fight resume. In recent weeks, it was announced that Diaz and current UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones were set to coach opposite one another on the Russian reality fight show ""ALF Global."" The series has often been equated to ""The Ultimate Fighter"" and featured former UFC champions Petr Yan and Aljamain Sterling as past coaches. However, Diaz's longtime teammate and fellow UFC veteran, Jake Shields, revealed Wednesday that Diaz and their crew have already left the show after a brawl broke out during fighter introductions. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Shields shared footage of the incident on his YouTube channel. Diaz and Jones were filming the show in Thailand, doing team introductions, when Jones' fighter - 19-17 welterweight veteran Zalimkhan Yusupov - started instigating with Diaz. Soon after, a member of Diaz's team attacked Yusupov, which escalated the whole situation. This wasn't Yusupov's first incident on ""ALF Global,"" as he infamously choked out former UFC bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling on the show's previous season. According to Shields, Yusupov was allowed back into the room rather than fully removed from the show, which led to Shields' own involvement. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement ""Right when I started to go off on him, I got just blitzed from the side,"" Shields said. ""Not where the fighters were - a couple of guys just started blitzing me, which to me seemed like they were crew working there, not fighters, because the fighters were in the chairs. ""To me, it was very clear that it was the staff and the workers. That was one of those moments where, like, I better diffuse the situation."" Shields added that the ""ALF Global"" production team did their best to entice Diaz and his team to remain in Thailand and continue working on the season, however, they opted to fly back home to California. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement ""Why are we going to go back and film a show [where this is happening]? It's one thing to be fighting the fighters - that's why I went out there with Nate, I thought it was a possibility some of these fighters will try to test him - but when you have potentially the crew hitting you too, it's like, 'No, f*** that,'"" Shields said. Diaz, 40, hasn't competed since his boxing rematch against Jorge Masvidal in July 2024. He won the match via majority decision."

And while there are still some hurdles to clear, we couldn't wait to build our ideal roster. By  - The NFL's quest for complete domination of the sports calendar took a significant step forward on Tuesday, as team owners unanimously voted to allow league players to participate in Olympic flag football in the 2028 Games. There are still a few loose ends for the NFL, its players association, and the various Olympic governing bodies to tie up before we see league stars competing on the international stage in Los but getting team owners to approve the measure was easily the biggest hurdle to clear. Now, we have a pretty good idea of how this will work: Only one player from each NFL team will be allowed to participate, and ""each club's designated international player is also permitted to take part for his country,"" according to the league's website. The rosters will consist of 10 players total, and the games will be five-on-five played on a 50-by-25-yard field (not including the 10-yard end zones). If you want to get a sense of how the matches will look, here's a replay of the gold medal game between the United States and Italy at the 2022 World Games. It's a rather absurd version of the football we watch every weekend in the fall. There's no offensive line, there's barely any semblance of a run game, and kicking has been eliminated from the sport. The offense starts every possession from its own 5-yard line (even following turnovers) and has four downs to make it past midfield. If that happens, the offense gets four more downs to find the end zone. The player who receives the snap, whether it's a quarterback or skill player, cannot cross the line of scrimmage. The quarterback is allowed to hand the ball off to a teammate for a run play in the open field, but it's pass only once the offense gets to the opponent's 5-yard line. The rules were certainly not designed to please football purists. One thing that remains unclear is how many NFL players would be interested in signing up to participate and whether the United States would be able to field a football version of the Dream Team. Plus, while team owners are willing to loan their players out for the summer, it's hard to imagine that the coaches will be enthused by the prospect of their top players missing the start of training camp and exposing themselves to a potential season-derailing injury. I don't want to spoil the fun, but there's a decent shot that we'll be watching a Zach Wilson-esque player lead Team USA onto the field in a few years. We can worry about that in 2028. For now, let's pretend that the U.S. Olympic Committee will have the NFL's full talent available to fill out the team. This isn't real football, so it's not as easy as copying and pasting the latest All-Pro team onto the roster and calling it a day. If this fake roster is going to dominate the international competition, as we all expect it to, it'll require specific skill sets. With that in mind, let's determine the U.S.'s dream flag football roster (plus a couple of potential alternates). Offense Quarterback: Kyler Murray I, like every other football fan, laughed when Darrell ""Housh"" Doucette, Team USA's incumbent flag football starter, claimed that he was a better quarterback option than Patrick Mahomes for this version of the sport. But after watching the 5-foot-7 passer's work against Italy, I don't think he was that far off base. It bears repeating: This is not real football. There's no offensive or defensive line, so there is no pocket. The receivers aren't running NFL passing concepts, and the quarterbacks aren't making NFL-style reads. Based on the 20 or so minutes I spent watching exactly one flag football game, it appears that the most important attribute for a quarterback isn't timing, precision, or pocket presence; it's being able to make the free rusher-who has to start 7 yards off the line of scrimmage but gets a free attempt at the QB-miss and resetting to throw the ball downfield. That appears to be the only consistent way to create explosive plays. So I have to apologize to all the great quarterbacks we have in the NFL: Your skill sets are largely useless to us here at the Fake Flag Football Committee. Instead, we're taking Kyler Murray and asking him to lean into his most chaotic tendencies. We want every play to be a scramble drill ending with a pass. We'll take a cue from the Cardinals and mandate that Kyler studies tape of Doucette to prepare him for the games. Our boy Housh doesn't sit in the pocket looking to pick apart defenses with quick processing. He welcomes mess, and so will our quarterback. Now, you're probably thinking: If you're looking for elusiveness, why not go with Lamar Jackson? Well, we're limited to one player per team, and our secret weapon on the defensive side is a Raven. I'm sure that Lamar would be a dominant flag quarterback, but the gap between him and Kyler wouldn't be that big from a flag football perspective. Receiver: Justin Jefferson This doesn't need much of an explanation. He's the best receiver in the NFL, and his well-rounded abilities would translate perfectly to the flag game. Jefferson is already on record saying he'd play for Team USA, and he called winning a gold medal ""a dream."" Well, welcome to the squad, Jettas. We'll mostly utilize Jefferson's receiving skills, but we'll also take advantage of his ability to throw the football. Since 2020, he ranks second in the NFL in non-QB pass attempts and averages over 11 yards per attempt. In the flag game, non-quarterback pass attempts are a viable and essential strategy. Running back: Bijan Robinson Receivers will fill out the rest of the offense, but I wanted to save at least one spot for a running back. I considered other electric backs like Saquon Barkley and Jahmyr Gibbs but ultimately landed on the Falcons star, who might be the best make-you-miss back in the league at the moment. Per Pro Football Focus, he forced 25 missed tackles after the catch last season. And these weren't ""run through your face mask"" missed tackles, either. Snatching Robinson's flag will be downright impossible for the rest of the world. Receiver: Mike Evans I can't overstate how crucial the red zone offense is in the flag game. As you can imagine, with four eligible receivers and four coverage players sharing a field that's only 25 yards wide, things get pretty cramped near the goal line. Having a giant target who can sky over shorter defenders and snatch the ball out of the air will be the key to finishing off drives with points. The same is true for point-after attempts, which are often the deciding factor in these games. (Remember, there's no kicking in flag football, so the offense attempts what is essentially a two-point try from the 5-yard line to get that seventh point-or they can go for two extra points from the 10.) Receiver: Tee Higgins What's better than one giant red zone target? That's right: two giant red zone targets. It also helps that both Evans and Higgins are masters at tracking downfield passes in the air and making contested catches. We're hunting big plays in the passing game. Crisp route running and racking up yards after the catch is of secondary importance, so Higgins gets the call-even over his teammate Ja'Marr Chase, who'd be the choice if we were playing real football. Alternate: Amon-Ra St. Brown We do need at least one smaller, jitterbug receiver on the roster. St. Brown's receiving chops and general evasiveness are enough to warrant his inclusion on this team, but blocking him from potentially playing for the German team-his mom is from Leverkusen-is a bonus. It will also help to have another non-giant around to make Kyler feel a bit taller by comparison, which should give our quarterback's confidence a boost. Defense Cornerbacks: Derek Stingley Jr. and Patrick Surtain II I'm lumping these guys together because the reasoning for their selection is the same: We want long, rangy corners with smooth movement skills and ball-hawking abilities. Both can stick tight to receivers, which will help in the open field, and have preternatural instincts in zone coverage, which will be vital in the red zone. I'd also trust them to hold up in coverage on an island, and in this version of the sport, every coverage outside of the red zone plays out like Cover Zero. Cornerback might be the most important position in flag football, and the demands of the position aren't much different from the real game. Taking the NFL's two best cover corners (for my money) makes the most sense here. The wild card: Travis Hunter This is a nod to the original Dream Team-which featured a rookie Christian Laettner, fresh off winning National Player of the Year in college basketball-and an attempt at making the best use of a limited roster. With squads limited to only 10 players, we don't have much of a bench, so why not take a player who can play on both sides of the ball? The Heisman Trophy winner seems to master anything he's asked to do on a football field, so it shouldn't be hard to carve out a nice role for him. Hopefully, his pro career will turn out better than Laettner's did. Red zone specialist: Fred Warner We won't subject Warner to playing coverage in the open field, but his zone instincts and inexplicable ability to feel routes developing behind him would make him the perfect red zone defender in flag football. Warner is the rare linebacker who can eliminate multiple routes on a single play. That will come in handy on a cramped field. Designated pass rusher: Kyle Hamilton Hamilton may be a jack-of-all-trades for the Ravens, but on our team, he'll do one thing and one thing only: rush the passer. As players in this position get a free run at the quarterback, we have no use for a deep bag of pass rush moves or strength in the trenches. We need a guy who can run fast in a straight line, adjust his angle of pursuit if the quarterback takes off, and block out the sun with his wingspan. Hamilton checks every box, and I believe his ability to bat passes out of the air would make him the most dominant flag football defender of all I mean, look at this guy: Darrell ""Housh"" Doucette wouldn't have an answer for that. (Though there is one major hurdle to Hamilton's inclusion on this team: his seeming desire to play for South Korea. Looks like the USOC has some lobbying to do.) Alternate: Christian Gonzalez Gonzalez has yet to break out as a household name, but by 2028, he'll be viewed as one of the best corners in the game. Like Stingley and Surtain, Gonzalez has the ideal length, playmaking instincts, and sticky coverage ability to thrive in flag football, making him an ideal reserve option."

Xiaomi is winning the battle on the pricing of its latest phone. The new Xiaomi 15S Pro starts at 5,499 yuan ($764) - making it eligible for a state-subsidized discount - and is significantly cheaper than Apple models containing the company's most advanced phone chip. The iPhone 16 Pro starts at 7,999 yuan, while the iPhone Pro Max model begins at 9,999 yuan - above the 6,000 yuan cut-off for a Chinese government discount for consumers. And Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun claims his company also has a competitive chip, saying at a launch event on Thursday that Xiaomi's new Xring O1 beat Apple's A18 Pro on several technical metrics, including the ability to operate a game with less heat. CNBC has not independently verified these claims. CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. ""Apple is still number one,"" Lei said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation. He said the Xring O1's performance should not be seen as an attempt to pressure Apple, but rather as an indicator of the great effort Xiaomi made to develop a comparable processor. The U.S. has increasingly restricted China's ability to access high-end equipment for developing advanced semiconductors used in training artificial intelligence models. Lei did not discuss any significant AI features for the 15S Pro, but showed how it could be used to lock and unlock a compatible car. He announced that Xiaomi will spend 200 billion yuan on research and development in the next five years, starting from 2026, and predicted 30% revenue growth this year. Lei had teased the 3 nanometer chip last week on Chinese social media app Weibo. He later noted the chip is in mass production and said the company would invest at least 50 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) over the next 10 years in its own chip development. Apple's iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max use A18 Pro chips built on the same 3 nanometer process. Around 40% of Xiaomi's phones currently use chips by Qualcomm and MediaTek, according to Counterpoint Research Partner Niel Shah. Xiaomi spent 13.5 billion ($1.87 billion) over four years to develop the Xring O1, Lei said in a social media post. He revealed that the company started developing chips in 2014 and unveiled one in 2017, before temporarily suspending such research. Last spring, Xiaomi launched its first electric car, the SU7 sedan, with a price $4,000 below that of Tesla's Model 3 at the time. Ford CEO Jim Farley said he spent months driving a Xiaomi electric car, as he tried to assess competition from Chinese automakers. Xiaomi's first SUV, called the YU7, will be officially released in July, Lei said in a social media post, noting the car's price wouldn't be revealed Thursday. Lei did share some promotional images and car features at the event. Lei said the YU7 car would use Qualcomm Snapdragon and Nvidia Thor chips. The standard version of the vehicle will come with advanced driver assist and a driving range of 835 km. The company delivered more than 28,000 vehicles in April, down from its record of more than 29,000 during the previous month. That comes after the crash of an SU7 vehicle in China, which left three people dead. China has since required automakers to use more conservative language when advertising driver-assist systems. Xiaomi is set to release its first-quarter results on May 27, after the company in March reported record revenue and net profit for 2024. Sales generated from overseas markets last year accounted for nearly 42% of total revenue. The company's shares remain more than 50% higher year-to-date. - CNBC's Arjun Kharpal and Bernice Ooi contributed to this report."

Typically, Fowler says, he is able to gather clues about who controls an exposed database from its contents-details about the organization, data related to its customers or employees, or other indicators that suggest why the data is being collected. This database, however, didn't include any clues about who owns the data or where it may have been gathered from. The sheer range and massive scope of the login details, which include accounts connected to a large array of digital services, indicate that the data is some sort of compilation, possibly kept by researchers investigating a data breach or other cybercriminal activity or owned directly by attackers and stolen by infostealer malware. ""This is probably one of the weirdest ones I've found in many years,"" Fowler says. ""As far as the risk factor here, this is way bigger than most of the stuff I find, because this is direct access into individual accounts. This is a cybercriminal's dream working list."" Each record included an ID tag for the type of account, a URL for each website or service, and then usernames and plaintext passwords. Fowler notes that the password field was called ""Senha,"" the Portuguese word for password. In a sample of 10,000 records analyzed by Fowler, there were 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. That sample-just a tiny fraction of the total exposure-also included Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, Twitter, WordPress, and Yahoo logins, among many others. A keyword search of the sample by Fowler returned 187 instances of the word ""bank"" and 57 of ""wallet."" Fowler, who did not download the data, says he contacted a sample of the exposed email addresses and heard back from some that they were genuine accounts. Aside from individuals, the exposed data also presented potential national security risks, Fowler says. In the 10,000 sample records there were 220 email addresses with .gov domains. These were linked to at least 29 countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, China, India, Israel, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom. While Fowler could not identify who had put the database together or where the login details originally came from, he reported the data exposure to World Host Group, the hosting company it was linked to. Access to the database was quickly shut down, Fowler says, although World Host Group did not respond to the researcher until after it was contacted by WIRED. Seb de Lemos, CEO of World Host Group, tells WIRED in a statement that the company operates systems for more than 2 million websites. The database Fowler found, though, is ""an unmanaged server"" hosted on World Host Group's infrastructure and fully controlled by a customer. ""It appears a fraudulent user signed up and uploaded illegal content to their server,"" de Lemos wrote in the statement. ""The system has since been shut down. Our legal team is reviewing any information we have that might be relevant for law enforcement."" De Lemos says that the company is in touch with Fowler and has made improvements to its reporting system. ""Whilst we cannot share customer-specific details with WIRED, we will fully cooperate with the appropriate law enforcement authorities and, where appropriate, share all relevant customer data with them."" Though the database has now been secured-and ultimately taken down entirely-it is not clear whether anyone other than Fowler accessed the trove while it was still live. As with any exposed database, the concern is that sensitive data could be stolen and abused. And in this case, there is a particularly urgent risk of logins being exploited in fraud, to steal additional information, or even to breach other organizations. Fowler says that while he does not know for certain, he suspects that the data was compiled by attackers using an infostealer. ""It is highly possible that this was a cybercriminal,"" he says. ""It's the only thing that makes sense, because I can't think of any other way you would get that many logins and passwords from so many services all around the world."""

This went down about as well as you'd expect, prompting Pitchford to yesterday follow-up with a clip of him on a panel talking about a potential price increase in, wait for it, much more sober and considered terms. So, in the interest of not only reporting on Pitchford when he says something incredibly stupid (although, lets be real, only because it's related, I'm still muckraking here) here's the clip. When asked about the game's price, Pitchford says he doesn't know. ""It's an interesting time, right? We've got a competitive marketplace. We want people to buy it so we've got the resources to make more. The people that make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people who are price-sensitive. We want everyone who buys and plays a Gearbox game to feel certain they got the better end of the bargain."" ""Game budgets are increasing,"" he continues. ""There's tariffs for the retail packaging. It's getting gnarly out there. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget (of 3)"". Then he veers off to talk about his philosophy of entertainment, etc. There's surely debates to be had about some of the points Pitchford raises although, crucially, none of it puts the onus on ""fans"" to be ""real"" enough to go lick fleas from goats for pennies. Why didn't you just say all this in the first place, Pitchford? I understand Twitter is where nuance goes to die, but don't tell me that you're above long threads now. Also, no, having a character in Borderlands 4 reference your original tweet to reframe your idiot posting as a charming foible will not absolve you of this. Although it would at least be refreshingly recent as far as Borderlands references go."

The $849.99 camera is so dedicated to an analog-like lifestyle that it's got an entire secondary screen just for picking one of its 13 film simulations, and it doesn't shoot RAW photos at all - just JPGs, for a more what-you-see-is-what-you-get experience. Fujifilm's definition of a half-frame is a bit different from the traditional one. Usually, a half-frame film camera like the Pentax 17 captures images measuring 18mm x 24mm (around half the size of full-frame / 35mm format). But the X Half uses a 1-inch-type sensor measuring 8.8mm x 13.3mm, which is about half the dimensions of the APS-C sensors in other Fujifilm cameras like the X100VI and X-T5. So I guess it counts on a technicality. [Image: https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/KV_X-half_white-back_11.jpg?quality=90&strip=all] [Image: https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/KV_X-half_white-back_38.jpg?quality=90&strip=all] [Image: https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/KV_X-half_street_268.jpg?quality=90&strip=all] But like the Pentax 17 and other actual half-frame cameras, the X Half is all about taking casual, fun snapshots and bringing it with you everywhere. It weighs just 8.5 ounces / 240 grams and is small enough to fit in most small bags or even some oversized pockets. The X Half is close in size to a traditional disposable camera, but unlike a one-time-use film camera it has a proper glass autofocusing lens with aspherical corrections, and it even shoots some basic 1080 x 1440 video. (Though, in my briefing on the camera, Justin Stailey of Fujifilm North America described the lens as having ""some character."" Which is often a colorful way of saying the lens isn't the sharpest.) Once you take some shots via the X Half's traditional optical viewfinder (that's right, there's no EVF or hybrid finder here) or its portrait-orientation 2.4-inch touchscreen, you can connect to a dedicated smartphone app (launching slightly after the camera) for extra functions. You can create your own two-up diptychs like a traditional half-frame camera, though here you can pick out the two side-by-side pictures, or you can opt for two videos or one picture and one video. Fujifilm has baked other analog-inspired features into the X Half app, like a Film Camera Mode that collects your next 36, 54, or 72 images and arranges them into a contact sheet. But the film nerdiness goes deeper than that, as the digital film strip will be branded with the film simulation you used. There's even a faux film advance lever for making diptychs, and in Film Camera Mode it forces you to use it between taking each shot. [Image: The faux film advance lever. https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/KV_X-half_street_104.jpg?quality=90&strip=all] You can lean further into the film kitsch by adding filters, like a light leak effect, expired film look, or a '90s-era time and date stamp to the corner. Of course, since the camera does not shoot RAW, your chosen filter and film simulation are fully baked into the JPG file. You can't undo any of them or change it later in post-processing like you'd normally be able to with a RAW. Fujifilm is certainly taking a unique approach with the X Half, trying to capture the interest of younger photo enthusiasts who in recent years have been drawn to the imperfections and vibes of vintage film and aging point-and-shoot digital cameras. I don't know how many of them will be jumping at the opportunity to scratch that creative itch with an $850 camera compared to alternatives costing a fraction of that - like a $70 Camp Snap for digital or any 35mm disposable film camera for $10 to $20 - but even if it's half the fun I had with the Pentax 17 it should prove a good time."

As of right now, Fortnite is the number one free game. Apple allowed Fortnite back on the U.S. App Store last night, ending a five year ban on the game that started when the legal battle between Apple and Epic Games kicked off. Epic Games' original developer account continues to be banned, but it was able to offer the game in the U.S. through the Epic Games Sweden subsidiary that it created to distribute Fortnite in the European Union. Apple didn't want to bring Fortnite back to the App Store, but Epic Games filed a complaint when Apple refused, and the judge overseeing the case suggested that Apple figure it out or face more time in court. Because Apple had to change its App Store rules to allow developers to link to purchase options outside of the App Store, Fortnite includes in-game purchases that do not use in-app purchase. Fortnite gives players the option to purchase currency and items directly from the Fortnite website, with no cut of the payment going to Apple. Apple is still appealing the court's ruling that forced it to change its App Store rules, and it has asked for a stay while the appeals process plays out. Several companies today filed amicus briefs in support of Epic Games, and against the stay. Spotify said that it is already seeing a substantial increase in the number of iOS users that have upgraded to Premium in the last two weeks, while Microsoft said increased choice, innovation, and competition will be ""best served"" by enforcing the injunction through Apple's appeal."

But it appears that this was a peak for iPhone loyalty according to data After peaking at 94% in 2023, the percentage of iPhone owners whose next phone was also from Apple took a shocking nosedive down to 89% and that percentage remained the same this year. It's easy to blame the decline on a lack of innovation on Apple's part. Galaxy phone when the time came to upgrade has risen from 68% in 2021 to 76% this year. It hasn't been a straight rise in the up elevator for Samsung as the South Korean manufacturer experienced a minor hiccup in 2024 with a small 1% decline in brand loyalty.

The data suggests that Apple, including its Beats subsidiary, continues to leverage its hardware-software ecosystem to dominate the true wireless stereo (TWS) market. Although its market share declined slightly from 24.4% in the first quarter of 2024, Apple still obtained a 12% year-over-year growth in shipments, contributing significantly to the global market's overall rebound. Total global TWS shipments rose to 78.3 million units-marking an 18% annual increase, which is the fastest growth rate for the category since 2021. Leading brands are reportedly expanding aggressively in both geographic reach and product positioning to capture new customers. Apple's continued growth is attributed to its strategic focus on adding health-related integrations and ecosystem. Features such as seamless device switching, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and hands-free Siri continue to differentiate Apple's products in a crowded and increasingly price-sensitive market. The latest Powerbeats Pro 2 include heart rate monitoring, while the AirPods Pro 2 now feature a series of hearing health functionalities, including the ability to work as medical-grade hearing aids. While Apple continues to lead in established markets, including North America where it holds over 50% market share, growth in emerging regions is being driven by aggressive pricing and localization strategies from rival vendors. For example, Xiaomi achieved a 63% year-over-year increase in shipments, reaching nine million units and surpassing Samsung to become the second-largest TWS vendor globally. Samsung, which includes Harman subsidiaries such as JBL, shipped 5.6 million units and held a 7.1% share. Huawei and Indian brand boAt rounded out the top five, with a 6.0% and 4.9% market share respectively. The broader market shift away from basic audio functionality toward lifestyle and ecosystem value places Apple in a favorable position, provided it continues to expand the utility and desirability of its headphone offerings. Canalys attributed the U.S. market's renewed growth partly to inventory buildup ahead of anticipated tariff changes, which prompted retail partners to stockpile high-demand products, including Apple's. Canalys also highlighted the growing momentum of open-ear wireless devices (OWS), a category that includes ear-hook and ear-clip designs aimed at merging audio technology with fashion and a more ambient listening experience. OWS products currently trail traditional TWS devices in terms of audio fidelity, but Canalys said that some vendors are working with audio labs to narrow the gap. While Apple has not entered the OWS segment, the trend toward lifestyle-oriented form factors could influence the company's future products."
Clair Obscur’s Real Heroes Came Before Expedition 33 - aftermath.site,technology,"The game's journals can be helpful, insightful, or just really funny",Ian Walker,Aftermath.site,2025-05-21T15:16:00+00:00,"Before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which has been the talk of the town since launching on April 25, creative director Guillaume Broche was working on a precursor known as We Lost.

While technically different projects, this title is still fitting of Clair Obscur's overall mood. As its protagonists set out from Lumiere to try to prevent the godlike Paintress from wiping humanity from existence, the palpable fear among Expedition 33 is that their hard work will, like the voyages before them, simply be a suicidal stepping stone on the path of future generations' success. (This piece contains spoilers for Clair Obscur's journal entries, and some vague late-game spoilers for the end of Act II.) Not only is this sense of impending failure baked into the mission's motto, ""We lay the trail for those who come after,"" but it's also part of why expeditions keep a journal to leave behind for subsequent expeditions. The average player will stumble upon several of these journals while playing Clair Obscur, each one full of stories describing the actions taken by previous expeditions and, sometimes, the dangers that ultimately defeated them. Not every journal provides useful information: Expedition 36's entry, for instance, is a beautiful albeit strategically useless poem, while Expedition 47's merely describes the self-styled ""Drunken Brigade's"" theories on maintaining inebriation during battle. But the majority drive home the fact that Expedition 33's success is predicated not only on their own skills but also the progress made by their predecessors. Clair Obscur heightens this sense of asynchronous cooperation by plopping its heroes down in hostile, unfamiliar territory and giving them no other choice than to rely on what previous expeditions left behind. Many areas would be impossible to traverse without various handholds and grapple points; the player eventually learns these aren't natural, but rather manmade features built into the environment by Expeditions 69 and 70. Similarly, a fleshy overpass in a late-game area is revealed as the grisly work of Expedition 35, who used their final moments after falling to a powerful monster to build the walkway over an otherwise unnavigable crevasse with their own corpses. ""So that's what it means to lay the trail,"" Expedition 35's journal reads, its long-dead author combining gallows humor with numerous passages from the overall mission statement. ""They used their bodies to create a bridge for those who come after. Expedition 35 is over but tomorrow comes."" Even when previous expeditions haven't left tangible help, their journals function like military intel for the challenges Expedition 33 faces. Expedition 59's journal cautions against eating defeated monsters, while a member of Expedition 66 left behind similar warnings for poisonous mushrooms they were given by Esquie, a lovable traveling companion you meet halfway into the game who functions like a Final Fantasy airship. The player might glean insight into how to allocate character stats from, say, Expedition 49, who focused entirely on healing and defensive skills, only to realize this turtle-like strategy only prolonged their suffering without offensive abilities to quickly dispatch enemies. This journal can remind the player that it's useful to spread points around rather than focus too heavily on a single aspect of a character's build. Sometimes Expedition 33 must literally stand on the shoulders of their ancestors to forge ahead, but other journal entries aren't quite as gruesome or on-the-nose. Expedition 40 discovered the forcefield surrounding the Paintress' monolith after two explorers flew into it on hang gliders and were vaporized. Expedition 44 attempted to disguise themselves as monsters, but the real monsters weren't fooled and cut them down. None of these journal entries hold a candle to Expedition 60. While much of Expedition 33's success comes from its use of the Lumina Converter, the in-universe tool that powers Clair Obscur's Picto trait customization system, Expedition 60 was able to make it all the way to the Paintress without such frivolity. They even managed to break through the barrier surrounding her monolith through pure strength alone, and did it all while entirely naked to boot. I've included the entire text of the journal below because there's no way a mere summary could do it justice. They mocked us when we said the human body is the strongest of them all. We trained relentlessly and now our bodies have achieved the pinnacle of human performance, with which we are able to crush our enemies! We are SO much more agile and aerodynamic without the heavy uniforms constraining our glorious muscles. With Leslie's unstoppable training regime, WE ARE IMPERVIOUS. That's how we were able to charge through that ghostly gommage barrier and reach the Paintress. But it seems we've been wrong about what she is. The Paintress is just as trapped as we. The real terror lies beneath the Monolith. The rest of Expedition 60 marched on to confront him, while I was tasked to warn Lumiere. But it seems I might have run out of time. One last swim separates me from Lumiere, but even with my mighty muscles, I don't know if I can outswim the Gommage. So here I write my final message. Bare naked muscles will save the world! And don't waste time on the Paintress, aim for the bottom of the Monolith! Despite a push for more diversity in games, they can often lean libertarian or even conservative in their worldviews. Some, in pursuit of gratifying player power fantasies, fall into subscribing to a version of Thomas Carlyle's ""great man"" theory, which argues history belongs to individuals born with superior traits. Clair Obscur's treatment of its protagonists not as special heroes but as merely the next link in a chain of successes and failures makes for a far richer story than we often see from the medium. Expedition 33, though perhaps better equipped than those who came before them, are only able to accomplish what they do thanks to the hundreds of reinforcements who paved the way before them. The ability to defeat a boss in seconds with an overpowered build means nothing if you can't physically reach the enemy in the first place. Knowledge accrued over decades and shared between generations will always trump what one person can do on their own. In his 1935 poem ""Questions From a Worker Who Reads,"" writer Bertolt Brecht asks, ""Caesar defeated the Gauls. / Did he not even have a cook with him? / Philip of Spain wept when his armada went down. / Was he the only one to weep?"" Clair Obscur may not be as overtly political a text as Brecht's Marxist leanings, but it certainly interrogates the view of history - and video game narratives - that singular heroes succeed through their own strength. And much like ""Questions,"" it comes to the same conclusion: None of us, from the wealthy entrepreneur to the struggling freelancer, accomplish anything on our own."

The company brought another beige case to the Computex trade show this week, the vertically oriented FLP02 (via Tom's Hardware). If the original horizontally oriented FLP01 case called to mind a 386-era Compaq Deskpro, the FLP02 is a dead ringer for the kind of case you might have gotten for a generic 486 or early Pentium-era PC. That extends to having a Turbo button built into the front-on vintage PCs, this button could actually determine how fast the processor was allowed to run, though here, it's actually a fan speed control instead. A lock on the front also locks the power switch in place to keep it from being flipped off accidentally, something else real vintage PCs actually did. Despite its retro facade, the FLP02 is capable of fitting in even higher-end modern PC parts than the original FLP01. Front USB-A and USB-C ports are hidden behind a magnetic door on the front of the case, and its faux-5.25-inch floppy drives are just covers for drive bays that you could use for an optical drive or extra front I/O. Credit: Future Despite its retro looks, the FLP02 still tucks away support for modern amenities like front-facing USB-A and USB-C ports. On the inside, the case can fit full-size ATX motherboards and up to a 360 mm radiator for CPU cooling, and modern high-end GPUs like the GeForce RTX 5090 or 5080 should be able to fit inside. SilverStone says the FLP02 will ship in Q3 or Q4 of this year and that US buyers should be able to get it for $220. You can, of course, buy a modern high-end PC case for much less money. But if this kind of nostalgia-bait didn't move merchandise, companies wouldn't keep indulging in it."

That ingredient is your data, and it's only just scratched the surface in terms of how it can use your information to ""personalize"" Gemini's responses. Google first started letting users opt in to its ""Gemini with personalization"" feature earlier this year, which lets the AI model tap into your search history ""to provide responses that are uniquely insightful and directly address your needs."" But now, Google is taking things a step further by unlocking access to even more of your information - all in the name of providing you with more personalized, AI-generated responses. During Google I/O on Tuesday, Google introduced something called ""personal context,"" which will allow Gemini models to pull relevant information from across Google's apps, as long as it has your permission. One way Google is doing this is through Gmail's personalized smart replies - the AI-generated messages that you can use to quickly reply to emails. [Image: The new smart replies let you choose a response based on previous emails and files in Drive. https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Personalized-smart-replies-in-Gmail.png?quality=90&strip=all] To make these AI responses sound ""authentically like you,"" Gemini will pore over your previous emails and even your Google Drive files to craft a reply tailored to your conversation. The response will even incorporate your tone, the greeting you use the most, and even ""favorite word choices,"" according to Google. As an example, Google says if you're chatting with a friend about road trip advice, Gemini can search through your emails and files, allowing it to find hotel reservations and an itinerary you put together. It can then suggest a response that incorporates relevant information. That, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during the keynote, may even help you ""be a better friend."" It seems Google plans on bringing personal context outside Gemini, too, as its blog post announcing the feature says, ""You can imagine how helpful personal context will be across Search, Gemini and more."" Google said in March that it will eventually let users connect their YouTube history and Photos library to Gemini, too. The breadth of data that Google has access to could put Gemini far ahead of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which starts with a blank slate when it encounters a new user. Instead of having an idea of where someone might like to shop, their favorite foods, or how they typically compose their emails, ChatGPT will have to field several responses before it can start referring to its memories and old conversations. The same is true for other AI chatbots without Google's vast swaths of data, such as Anthropic's Claude. If it's given permission, Gemini can have access to all of this information - and more - right out the gate. That sets it up to be an even more helpful AI assistant that you don't even need to have a previous interaction with for it to ""know"" you."

Summarize it like I'm late for a meeting (Image credit: Daria Nipot/Shutterstock) If ChatGPT can do one thing really well, it's summarize - long articles, meeting notes, email threads, PDFs, you name it. A good summary prompt makes your reading list shorter and your life easier. After uploading a document to summarize, try these prompts: ""Summarize this text in 3 bullet points."" ""Give me a TL;DR of this article for a Gen Z audience."" ""What are the key takeaways from this document?"" ""Rewrite this news story in under 75 words."" Pro tip: You can even ask for summaries in the tone of your audience: formal, casual, sarcastic or even ""like a morning show host."" Just specify what you want and the chatbot will follow through. 2. Reframe it for the right moment (Image credit: Petar Chernaev / Getty Images) Sometimes you have the right message but the wrong tone. Reframing prompts help you turn awkward drafts into polished communication; or adapt one piece of content into multiple styles. After uploading the document you want to polish, try these prompts: Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors ""Rewrite this email to sound more confident but still friendly."" ""Make this LinkedIn post more engaging and less stiff."" ""Turn this paragraph into a tweet."" ""Make this less robotic and more human."" Pro tip: You can stack styles: ""Make this shorter, punchier, and funnier - like something you'd see in a Slack message."" You can even drop it into another chatbot for a completely new take. 3. Brainstorm like your creative friend who never runs out of ideas (Image credit: Pexels) Feeling stuck? ChatGPT thrives when you give it a creative problem and ask for quantity first, quality second. Use brainstorming prompts to generate ideas you can refine later. Try these prompts to get what you want: ""Give me 10 blog post ideas for a productivity website."" ""What are some unique ways to promote a book about burnout?"" ""Suggest some metaphors I can use to describe imposter syndrome."" ""Brainstorm unusual taglines for an eco-friendly sneaker brand."" Pro tip: Follow up with ""Make these funnier,"" ""Make them shorter,"" or ""Pick the best three and explain why."" 4. Compare like an unbiased (but extremely opinionated) assistant (Image credit: Getty Images) Comparison prompts help you cut through decision paralysis; whether you're choosing between gadgets, apps, or vacation spots. You can ask for side-by-side breakdowns, pros and cons, or even final recommendations. ""Compare the iPhone 15 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra for battery life, camera and AI features."" ""Pros and cons of switching from Notion to Google Keep."" ""Which is better for learning to code: Python or JavaScript?"" ""Give me a chart comparing the cost of these three gym memberships."" Pro tip: Ask ""Which would you choose for [your goal]?"" to get a confident AI pick and then press it on why. 5. Role-play your way to better answers (Image credit: DALL-E/Ryan Morrison) This is the secret weapon of power users. When you assign ChatGPT a persona or point of view, the responses become dramatically more focused, useful, and human-sounding. You're basically casting the AI in your own play. Try these prompts designed to imitate the persona you're looking for: ""Act like a nutritionist. Create a 7-day meal plan for someone with no time to cook."" ""You're a therapist. Give advice to someone dealing with imposter syndrome at work."" ""Pretend you're an ultra-picky hiring manager. Review this resume and list red flags."" ""You're a brand strategist. Give feedback on this company tagline."" Pro tip: Combine role-play with task and tone. Example: ""You're a chill Gen Z marketing intern. Give me feedback on this presenation."" Final thoughts You don't need hundreds of fancy prompts to get amazing results. Try these five types of prompts out and see which one, or all, work for you to help generate better results. Whichever chatbot you use, these can help support your efforts to summarize, reframe, brainstorm, compare and role-play to tackle just about any project."

The Bose soundbar has long been a favorite for those seeking solid performance at a reasonable price, and its current $279 price tag on Amazon is already considered a great deal. But Amazon's own Fire TV Soundbar is now available for just $89, which is a full three times less than the Bose counterpart (and a 25% discount from the original $119 price) and which makes it an unbeatable option for bargain hunters. See at Amazon Affordable Great Sound This newest Fire TV soundbar is a compact 2.0 channel soundbar which is designed to fit seamlessly into most living spaces with a length of just 24 inches and a height of 2.5 inches. Its minimalist design ensures it won't dominate your TV stand but don't let its size fool you: the dual speakers deliver a much fuller sound than what you'll get from standard TV speakers. Dialogue is more distinct, there's more noticeable bass, and the overall sound profile is richer which improves everything from sports to films. What really sets this soundbar apart is that it supports both Dolby Audio and DTS Virtual:X, two technologies that create a virtualized surround sound effect without extra speakers. DTS Virtual:X gives you a three-dimensional soundstage with action sequences that draw you in and a sense of space around music that's unheard of at this price. Dolby Audio adds more detail and clarity so you never miss a word or subtle sound effect. With the Fire TV Soundbar, whatever you're watching - the latest release or your favorite TV show - sounds far larger than it has any right to at this price. Setting up the Fire TV Soundbar is beautifully easy: Simply plug the included HDMI cable into your TV's HDMI eARC or ARC port, and you're ready to go. The soundbar automatically syncs with your TV audio, so there's no delay, and everything stays in perfect sync. No tricky setups or additional apps needed. If you'd like to listen to music, the built-in Bluetooth permits you to stream directly from your phone or tablet. The Fire TV Soundbar is also designed to work seamlessly with Fire TV devices and most smart TVs so that you can control your TV and soundbar using a single remote. With this integration, you're able to switch inputs, control volume, and navigate your entertainment system without juggling several remotes. With Memorial Day sales in full swing, the Amazon Fire TV Soundbar for $89 is one of the best deals you'll find for a serious sound upgrade. For nearly three times less than the Bose soundbar everyone raves about, you're getting a device that hits all the right notes. See at Amazon"

The Gemini 2.5 Pro-powered ""Stitch"" experiment is available on Google Labs and can turn text prompts and reference images into ""complex UI designs and frontend code in minutes,"" according to the announcement during Google's I/O event, sparing developers from manually creating design elements and then programming around them. Stitch generates a visual interface based on selected themes and natural language descriptions, which are currently supported in English. Developers can provide details they would like to see in the final design, such as color palettes or the user experience. Visual references can also be uploaded to guide what Stitch generates, including wireframes, rough sketches, and screenshots of other UI designs. Stitch allows users to generate ""multiple variants"" of an interface, according to Google, making it easier to experiment with different styles and layouts. The UI assets are generated alongside fully functional front-end code that can be added directly into apps or exported to Figma to refine the design elements, integrate with existing systems, and collaborate with designers. The export option is unsurprising given that Figma is already a well-established platform for product design tasks, and would be more capable of facilitating changes to specific visual elements. The automatic coding aspect of Stitch encroaches on Figma's Make UI building app, announced earlier this month, however. Google may be hoping that Stitch is the solution to prevent designers who were using Gemini's Code Assist tool from jumping ship entirely."
